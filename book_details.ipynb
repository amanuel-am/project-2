His sex drive is diminished, his parents are dead, and his lifelong obsession--the ideas and works of the novelist Joris-Karl Huysmans--has led him nowhere. In a late-capitalist society where consumerism has become the new religion, Franocois is spiritually barren, but seeking to fill the vacuum of his existence. And he is not alone. As the 2022 Presidential election approaches, two candidates emerge as favorites: Marine Le Pen of the Front National, and Muhammed Ben Abbes of the nascent Muslim Fraternity. Forming a controversial alliance with the mainstream parties, Ben Abbes sweeps to power, and overnight the country is transformed.

Yet today there is only one—homo sapiens. What happened to the others? And what may happen to us? Most books about the history of humanity pursue either a historical or a biological approach, but Dr. Yuval Noah Harari breaks the mold with this highly original book that begins about 70,000 years ago with the appearance of modern cognition. From examining the role evolving humans have played in the global ecosystem to charting the rise of empires, Sapiens integrates history and science to reconsider accepted narratives, connect past developments with contemporary concerns, and examine specific events within the context of larger ideas. Dr. Harari also compels us to look ahead, because over the last few decades humans have begun to bend laws of natural selection that have governed life for the past four billion years. We are acquiring the ability to design not only the world around us, but also ourselves. Where is this leading us, and what do we want to become?

I couldn\\'t put it down.\"---Ruth Buzzi, Golden Globe Award winner and Television Hall of Fame inductee \"Sadly, too many Americans have never heard of Victoria Woodhull, let alone learned of her story: her revolutionary campaign for the presidency at a time when women weren\\'t even allowed to vote, her support for worker\\'s rights, or her feminist commitment to equality, a century before the official battle over the Equal Rights Amendment. But in The Coming Woman, Karen Hicks brings Woodhull\\'s efforts to life, and reminds us that some of our nation\\'s greatest figures aren\\'t always featured in the history books. It is a riveting account of an amazing woman and her struggle for justice and human dignity, told in an engaging and eminently readable style.\"-Tim Wise, author, \"White Like Me: Reflections on Race from a Privileged Son\" \"The Coming Woman\" is a novel based on the life of feminist Victoria Woodhull, the first woman to run for U.S. President, 50 years before women could even vote Running for President wasn\\'t Victoria\\'s only first as a woman. She was also the first to own a successful Wall Street firm, the first to publish a successful national newspaper, and the first to head the two-million-member Spiritualist Association. She was the first woman to enter the Senate Judiciary Committee chambers to petition for woman\\'s suffrage, her argument changing the entire focus of the suffragist movement by pointing out that the 14th and 15th Amendments already gave women the vote. In her campaign for the Presidency, Victoria Woodhull boldly addressed many of the issues we still face today: equal pay for equal work; freedom in love; corporate greed and political corruption fueled by powerful lobbyists; and the increasing disparity between the rich and the poor, to name only a few. Her outspoken and common-sense ideas may shed a new perspective on the parallel conundrums of today\\'s world. This bold, beautiful, and sexually progressive woman dared to take on society and religion. To make an example of the hypocrisy in what Mark Twain dubbed The Gilded Age, she exposed the extramarital affairs of the most popular religious figure of the day (Henry Ward Beecher). This led to her persecution and imprisonment and the longest, most infamous trial of the 19th century. But it did not stop her fight for equality. Victoria\\'s epic story, set in the late 1800s, comes to life in a modern, fictional style, while staying true to the actual words and views of the many well-known characters.', 'industryIdentifiers': [{'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '1941644112'}, {'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9781941644119'}], 'readingModes': {'text': False, 'image': False}, 'pageCount': 334, 'printType': 'BOOK', 'categories': ['Feminism'], 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'allowAnonLogging': False, 'contentVersion': 'preview-1.0.0', 'panelizationSummary': {'containsEpubBubbles': False, 'containsImageBubbles': False}, 'imageLinks': {'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=MJqpoAEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=MJqpoAEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api'}, 'language': 'en', 'previewLink': 'http://books.google.com/books?id=MJqpoAEACAAJ&dq=The+Coming+Woman:+A+Novel+Based+on+the+Life+of+the+Infamous+Feminist,+Victoria+Woodhull&hl=&as_pt=BOOKS&cd=1&source=gbs_api', 'infoLink': 'http://books.google.com/books?id=MJqpoAEACAAJ&dq=The+Coming+Woman:+A+Novel+Based+on+the+Life+of+the+Infamous+Feminist,+Victoria+Woodhull&hl=&as_pt=BOOKS&source=gbs_api', 'canonicalVolumeLink': 'https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Coming_Woman.html?hl=&id=MJqpoAEACAAJ'}\n",

It was an unlikely quest from the start. With a team composed of the sons of loggers, shipyard workers, and farmers, the University of Washington’s eight-oar crew team was never expected to defeat the elite teams of the East Coast and Great Britain, yet they did, going on to shock the world by defeating the German team rowing for Adolf Hitler.

Seizing inspiration from the playwright’s own fascination with travel, foreignness, and distant worlds—worlds Shakespeare never himself explored—Andrew Dickson takes us on an extraordinary journey: from Hamlet performed by English actors tramping through the Baltic states in the early sixteen hundreds to the skyscrapers of twenty-first-century Beijing and Shanghai, where “Shashibiya” survived Mao’s Cultural Revolution to become a revered Chinese author. En route, Dickson traces Nazi Germany’s strange love affair with, and attempted nationalization of, the Bard, and delves deep into the history of Bollywood, where Shakespearean stories helped give birth to Indian cinema. In Johannesburg, we discover how Shakespeare was enlisted in the fight to end apartheid. In nineteenth-century California, we encounter shoestring performances of Richard III and Othello in the dusty mining camps and saloon bars of the Gold Rush. No other writer’s work has been performed, translated, adapted, and altered in such a remarkable variety of cultures and languages.

You can't bury them all follows the narratives we construct to survive the tragic failures of our humanity to their very end: everything that's buried by snow, dirt, and ash, just like everything that's buried by politics, homophobia, sexism, racism, religion, and history is resurrected, demanding to be heard and addressed. In Woodcock's poetry, how we deal with what resurfaces is the key. What do those who suffer really mean to those who have abandoned them to small, conscience-soothing charitable donations or the occasional tweet? How can the poet, or anyone else, sleep at night after YouTube documents homosexual Kurds being thrown off building tops; after a child's body is abandoned in an Azeri cemetery; or after the elders of an Aboriginal community are left helpless against businessmen who only want to exploit them?

What appears to be a story of mothers and daughters, of sisterhood put to the test, of adolescent love and grown-up misconduct, and of history’s long reach, becomes a provocative and compelling exploration of America’s failure to find a language to talk about race. “A magnificently textured, vital, visceral feat of storytelling . . .

This project turned into a quest to discover the secrets of the neighborhood’s flora and fauna, and yielded more than names and trivia: Johnson developed a relationship with his nonhuman neighbors. Johnson argues that learning to see the world afresh, like a child, shifts the way we think about nature: Instead of something distant and abstract, nature becomes real—all at once comical, annoying, and beautiful. This shift can add tremendous value to our lives, and it might just be the first step in saving the world. No matter where we live—city, country, oceanside, or mountains—there are wonders that we walk past every day. Unseen City widens the pinhole of our perspective by allowing us to view the world from the high-altitude eyes of a turkey vulture and the distinctly low-altitude eyes of a snail. The narrative allows us to eavesdrop on the comically frenetic life of a squirrel and peer deep into the past with a ginkgo biloba tree. Each of these organisms has something unique to tell us about our neighborhoods and, chapter by chapter, Unseen City takes us on a journey that is part nature lesson and part love letter to the world’s urban jungles.

Although we usually think of technology as something unique to modern times, our ancestors began to create the first technologies millions of years ago in the form of prehistoric tools and weapons. Over time, eight key technologies gradually freed us from the limitations of our animal origins. The fabrication of weapons, the mastery of fire, and the technologies of clothing and shelter radically restructured the human body, enabling us to walk upright, shed our body hair, and migrate out of tropical Africa. Symbolic communication transformed human evolution from a slow biological process into a fast cultural process. The invention of agriculture revolutionized the relationship between humanity and the environment, and the technologies of interaction led to the birth of civilization. Precision machinery spawned the industrial revolution and the rise of nation-states; and in the next metamorphosis, digital technologies may well unite all of humanity for the benefit of future generations. Synthesizing the findings of primatology, paleontology, archeology, history, and anthropology, Richard Currier reinterprets and retells the modern narrative of human evolution that began with the discovery of Lucy and other Australopithecus fossils. But the same forces that allowed us to integrate technology into every aspect of our daily lives have also brought us to the brink of planetary catastrophe. Unbound explains both how we got here and how human society must be transformed again to achieve a sustainable future.

What is the systemic problem that sets the rich against the poor and the technologists against everybody else? When protesters shattered the windows of a bus carrying Google employees to work, their anger may have been justifiable, but it was misdirected. The true conflict of our age isn’t between the unem\\xadployed and the digital elite, or even the 99 percent and the 1 percent. Rather, a tornado of technological improvements has spun our economic program out of control, and humanity as a whole—the protesters and the Google employees as well as the shareholders and the executives—are all trapped by the consequences. It’s time to optimize our economy for the human beings it’s supposed to be serving. In this groundbreaking book, acclaimed media scholar and author Douglas Rushkoff tells us how to combine the best of human nature with the best of modern technology.

At 28 years old, Scott Harrison had it all. A top nightclub promoter in New York City, his life was an endless cycle of drugs, booze, models—repeat. But 10 years in, desperately unhappy and morally bankrupt, he asked himself, \"What would the exact opposite of my life look like?\" Walking away from everything, Harrison spent the next 16 months on a hospital ship in West Africa and discovered his true calling.

They are the only family she has, aside from her paternal grandmother Dorothy, so when her uncle dies from the attack and her father lays comatose in ICU, it falls to Andrea to not only investigate who would want to kill her father and uncle, but also to oversee Harding Industries, the family company. When her father's longtime attorney and one of a handful of family friends, Beth Cowling, rushes to help Andrea long distance, the youngest Harding soon finds herself surrounded by a bevy of intriguing new friends and helpers. First to arrive is Beth's own daughter, Riva, acting as Andrea's attorney after Andrea is violently attacked in her father's home, where she grew up, forcing her to kill both would-be assassins. When Nicholas's on again/off again lover, state prosecutor and gubernatorial hopeful Kerry Marcus, is equally at a loss to name suspects in the Harding family attacks, Riva begins her own investigation into the short list of family friends and colleagues, including Don Marshall, former colleague of Nicholas's at Marshall Pharmaceutical, which Don now runs, and Don's wife Karen. Marshall has a shady past, including an incident at his company that also involved Andrea's father. She also looks closely at Marcus Ricci, father of Andrea's closest high school friend, Jason. After Jason's death from leukemia, Ricci becomes like a second father to Andrea. Ricci is also widely believed to have ties to the New Jersey mob. But Beth has another contact she wants involved in the investigation, Deirdre Southington, daughter of Beth's old friend Cordelia Southington. The Southington family has more money than God, as well as, through Deirdre, more contacts in the intriguing world of international espionage. A former NSA agent, Deirdre is mysterious and beautiful in a cold way. An eccentric who travels via private rail car, she is also extraordinarily persuasive, holding a PhD in forensic psychology that she has put to great use in both her work with the NSA and on her own, as a defender of good, rooting out evil doers and ensuring they are brought to her own brand of justice. Andrea, Riva, and Deirdre all also cast a suspicious eye on the Oakes brothers, Carlton and Jefferson, who run Oakes Industries along with their silent partner and cousin, New Jersey state senator Schuyler Colfax, who also has his eye on the governor's seat. Oakes Industries has recently made an attempt to purchase Harding Industries, a seemingly irrational move that is rebuffed by Nicholas. What no one knows until much later is that the Oakes brothers have entered into a business deal with Russian mobster Viktor Roman, who represents the real party interested in acquiring Harding Industries, a Vor, Russian organized crime unit, with heavy international interests in the energy sector. Andrea matures quickly as she rapidly learns who she can and cannot trust during her search for the people out to kill her family. Along with her new friends and advocates, she discovers Harding Industries holds a soon to expire option to buy property that could become the source of untold billions from oil reserves, and moves in the nick of time to exercise their right to purchase. But the biggest blow for the Harding family is yet to come--the discovery that Viktor Roman has promised Kerry Marcus the governor's seat in exchange for information about the Hardings, including Nicholas and Michael's whereabouts on the night they are shot. Ultimately, Andrea chooses to forego law school and becomes her father's new partner in Harding Industries, no doubt with many adventures yet to come. Masterfully told using a smattering of historical facts along with a soundtrack of classical music masterpieces, this thriller keeps readers on edge until the very end.\", 'industryIdentifiers': [{'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '1682226786'}, {'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9781682226780'}], 'readingModes': {'text': False, 'image': False}, 'pageCount': 0, 'printType': 'BOOK', 'categories': ['Fiction'], 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'allowAnonLogging': False, 'contentVersion': 'preview-1.0.0', 'panelizationSummary': {'containsEpubBubbles': False, 'containsImageBubbles': False}, 'imageLinks': {'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=pX6gjwEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=pX6gjwEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api'}, 'language': 'en', 'previewLink': 'http://books.google.com/books?id=pX6gjwEACAAJ&dq=The+Torch+Is+Passed:+A+Harding+Family+Story&hl=&as_pt=BOOKS&cd=1&source=gbs_api', 'infoLink': 'http://books.google.com/books?id=pX6gjwEACAAJ&dq=The+Torch+Is+Passed:+A+Harding+Family+Story&hl=&as_pt=BOOKS&source=gbs_api', 'canonicalVolumeLink': 'https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Torch_Is_Passed.html?hl=&id=pX6gjwEACAAJ'}\n",

Renowned ornithologist Tim Birkhead opens this gripping story as a female guillemot chick hatches, already carrying her full quota of tiny eggs within her undeveloped ovary. As she grows into adulthood, only a few of her eggs mature, are released into the oviduct, and are fertilized by sperm stored from copulation that took place days or weeks earlier. Within a matter of hours, the fragile yolk is surrounded by albumen and the whole is gradually encased within a turquoise jewel of a shell. Soon the fully formed egg is expelled onto a rocky ledge, where it will be incubated for four weeks before a chick emerges and the life cycle begins again. THE MOST PERFECT THING is about how eggs in general are made, fertilized, developed, and hatched.

Why should girls miss out on the joy of adventure? They can jump off rocks, swing on ropes, and climb trees just as well as boys can. But girls often allow fear to stand in their way. In The Gutsy Girl, author Caroline Paul emboldens girls to seek out a life of exhilaration. Once a young scaredy-cat herself, Caroline decided that fear got in the way of the life she wanted--of excitement, confidence, self-reliance, friendship, and fun. She has since flown planes, rafted big rivers, climbed tall mountains, and fought fires as one of the first female firefighters in San Francisco.

None of these existed in the actual mid-twentieth-century landscape of Deeds's own life, but rather were representations of his inner world—an artist's poignant tribute to a faded past. Deeds lovingly bound his artwork in a cardboard and leather portfolio, a present for his mother. After being accidentally discarded in 1970, the album was rescued from the trash by a young boy and, thirty-six years later, came into the hands of artist and collector Harris Diamant, who provides the book's foreword. The Electric Pencil features all 283 of Deeds's arresting drawings—now avidly collected—done on ledger sheets from State Hospital No. 3 in Nevada, Missouri, and reproduced in the sequence of the original album. The Electric Pencil introduces readers to an astonishing record of one man's unwavering artistic vision in the face of the most inhospitable conditions.\", 'industryIdentifiers': [{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9781616895013'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '1616895012'}], 'readingModes': {'text': True, 'image': True}, 'pageCount': 274, 'printType': 'BOOK', 'categories': ['Art'], 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'allowAnonLogging': False, 'contentVersion': '1.1.1.0.preview.3', 'panelizationSummary': {'containsEpubBubbles': False, 'containsImageBubbles': False}, 'imageLinks': {'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=R2S6CwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=R2S6CwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}, 'language': 'en', 'previewLink': 'http://books.google.com/books?id=R2S6CwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=The+Electric+Pencil:+Drawings+from+Inside+State+Hospital+No.+3&hl=&as_pt=BOOKS&cd=1&source=gbs_api', 'infoLink': 'http://books.google.com/books?id=R2S6CwAAQBAJ&dq=The+Electric+Pencil:+Drawings+from+Inside+State+Hospital+No.+3&hl=&as_pt=BOOKS&source=gbs_api', 'canonicalVolumeLink': 'https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Electric_Pencil.html?hl=&id=R2S6CwAAQBAJ'}\n",

When his excess fat started causing brain fog and food cravings sapped his energy and willpower, Asprey turned to the same hacking techniques that made his fortune to \"hack\" his own biology, investing more than $300,000 and 15 years to uncover what was hindering his energy, performance, appearance, and happiness. From private brain EEG facilities to remote monasteries in Tibet, through radioactive brain scans, blood chemistry work, nervous system testing, and more, he explored traditional and alternative technologies to reach his physical and mental prime. The result? The Bulletproof Diet, an anti-inflammatory program for hunger-free, rapid weight loss and peak performance. The Bulletproof Diet will challenge—and change—the way you think about weight loss and wellness. You will skip breakfast, stop counting calories, eat high levels of healthy saturated fat, work out and sleep less, and add smart supplements. In doing so, you\\'ll gain energy, build lean muscle, and watch the pounds melt off. By ditching traditional \"diet\" thinking, Asprey went from being overweight and sick in his twenties to maintaining a 100-pound weight loss, increasing his IQ, and feeling better than ever in his forties.

It was a time of creativity unparalleled in history before or since, from science to the arts, from philosophy to politics. Acclaimed philosopher and historian A.C.

Grayling vividly reconstructs this unprecedented era and breathes new life into the major figures of the seventeenth century intelligentsia who span literature, music, science, art, and philosophy--Shakespeare, Monteverdi, Galileo, Rembrandt, Locke, Newton, Descartes, Vermeer, Hobbes, Milton, and Cervantes, among many more.

Manderley Resort is a gleaming, new twenty-story hotel on the California coast. It’s about to open its doors, and the world--at least those with the means to afford it--will be welcomed into a palace of opulence and unparalleled security. But someone is determined that Manderley will never open. The staff has no idea that their every move is being watched, and over the next twelve hours they will be killed off, one by one.

Security is grand guignol storytelling at its very best. A shocking thriller, a brilliant narrative puzzle, and a multifaceted love story unlike any other, Security marks the debut of a fearless and gifted writer. “Be surprised, be very surprised: Gina Wohlsdorf brings more than just plot twists and a terrifically tender love story to this thriller . . .

The effect is terrifying, sexy, dizzying, and impossible to look away from.” —Tim Johnston, author of Descent “Shocking and filled with Tarantino-ish dark humor. . .

Newman', 'Hella Winston'], 'publisher': 'Macmillan + ORM', 'publishedDate': '2016-04-19', 'description': \"From Katherine Newman, award-winning author of No Shame in My Game, and sociologist Hella Winston, a sharp and irrefutable call to reenergize this nation's long-neglected system of vocational training After decades of off-shoring and downsizing that have left blue collar workers obsolete and stranded, the United States is now on the verge of an industrial renaissance. Companies like Apple, BMW, Bosch, and Volkswagen are all opening plants and committing millions of dollars to build products right here on American soil. The only problem: we don't have a skilled enough labor pool to fill these positions, which are in many cases technically demanding and require specialized skills. A decades-long series of idealistic educational policies with the expressed goal of getting every student to go to college has left a generation of potential workers out of the system. Touted as a progressive, egalitarian institution providing opportunity even to those with the greatest need, the American secondary school system has in fact deepened existing inequalities, leaving behind millions of youth, especially those who live in the de-industrialized Northeast and Midwest, without much of a future at all. We can do better, argue acclaimed sociologists Katherine Newman and Hella Winston. Taking a page from the successful experience of countries like Germany and Austria, where youth unemployment is a mere 7%, they call for a radical reevaluation of the idea of vocational training, long discredited as an instrument of tracking. The United States can prepare a new, high-performance labor force if we revamp our school system to value industry apprenticeship and rigorous technical education. By doing so, we will not only be able to meet the growing demand for skilled employees in dozens of sectors where employers decry the absence of well trained workers -- we will make the American Dream accessible to all.\", 'industryIdentifiers': [{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9781627793292'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '1627793291'}], 'readingModes': {'text': True, 'image': False}, 'pageCount': 282, 'printType': 'BOOK', 'categories': ['Education'], 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'allowAnonLogging': True, 'contentVersion': '2.3.4.0.preview.2', 'panelizationSummary': {'containsEpubBubbles': False, 'containsImageBubbles': False}, 'imageLinks': {'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=n5yfCgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=n5yfCgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}, 'language': 'en', 'previewLink': 'http://books.google.com/books?id=n5yfCgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Reskilling+America:+Learning+to+Labor+in+the+Twenty-First+Century&hl=&as_pt=BOOKS&cd=1&source=gbs_api', 'infoLink': 'https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=n5yfCgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api', 'canonicalVolumeLink': 'https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=n5yfCgAAQBAJ'}\n",

Both of them greeted the sound with gentle smiles. Then Jace spoke without smiling, but with such gentleness still, as lightning illuminated the night gray sky. “I think, Julia, that you are absolutely fearless.” “No, Jace. I’m not. On paper maybe I might seem that way. On plans conjured months in advance and an ocean away. But now that I’m here . . .” “I would be very happy to prove my point. By accompanying you to Canterfields.” “Really?” “Of course.” “I . . . yes. Thank you. That makes me feel safe.” Oh, Julia Anne Hayley, he thought, you are not safe with me. For him, love was a nightmare . . . Haunted by memories of a Christmas Eve inferno, trauma surgeon Jace Colton guards his solitude as fiercely and as passionately as he tends to the desperately injured who need his care. For her, love is an awakening . . . Julia Anne Hayley\\'s memories are lovely, not haunting, a billowy cocoon in which she has hidden from life, from living, far too long. But she knows it is time to leave the solitary sanctuary that is her home, and, if she dares, to fly. Jace and Julia have six magical days—and nights—in London at Christmas. But their Christmastime enchantment is like a snowflake, delicate, perfect, and destined to die. The magic cannot possibly last . . . can it? Praise for the novels of Katherine Stone: “Katherine Stone’s unique voice is clearly evident in this newest lyrical tale . . . an almost mystical quality that is distinctly her own.”—Romantic Times on A Midnight Clear “A shimmering, hypnotic story of two wounded souls who heal each other. An addictive and indulgent treat.”—Bookbug on A Midnight Clear “Remarkably romantic and thoroughly enchanting.”—Rendezvous on Pearl Moon “Poignant . . . Cass is an intrepid heroine, but it is Chase who wins our hearts when he refuses to allow Cass’s seeming betrayal to stop him from protecting his beloved.”—Midwest Book Review on Bed of Roses “Fairytale elements mix with those of a present day romance for . . . thoroughly enjoyable results.”—Kirkus Reviews on Rainbows Katherine Stone writes “in the vein of Danielle Steel and Sandra Brown”—Library Journal “Alluring . . . Fascinating . . . Each page brings a new adventure, every plot twist another question begging to be answered.”—Rendezvous on Imagine Love “Heart-tugging . . . few romance fans will remain unmoved.”—Publishers Weekly on Thief of Hearts Katherine Stone\\'s \"high quality romance ranks right up there with Nora Roberts.\"—Booklist “Sweeping drama . . .

When we moved to West Virginia right before my senior year, I'd pretty much resigned myself to thick accents, dodgy internet access, and a whole lot of boring...until I spotted my hot neighbor, with his looming height and eerie green eyes. Things were looking up. And then he opened his mouth. Daemon is infuriating. Arrogant. Stab-worthy. We do not get along. At all. But when a stranger attacks me and Daemon literally freezes time with a wave of his hand, well, something...unexpected happens. The hot alien living next door marks me. You heard me. Alien. Turns out Daemon and his sister have a galaxy of enemies wanting to steal their abilities, and Daemon's touch has me lit up like the Vegas Strip. The only way I'm getting out of this alive is by sticking close to Daemon until my alien mojo fades. If I don't kill him first, that is.

Get! Read! Now!\" —Tamora Pierce, #1 New York Times bestselling author I Needed to Win. They Needed to Die. Sallot Leon is a thief, and a good one at that. But gender fluid Sal wants nothing more than to escape the drudgery of life as a highway robber and get closer to the upper-class—and the nobles who destroyed their home. When Sal steals a flyer for an audition to become a member of The Left Hand—the Queen\\'s personal assassins, named after the rings she wears—Sal jumps at the chance to infiltrate the court and get revenge. But the audition is a fight to the death filled with clever circus acrobats, lethal apothecaries, and vicious ex-soldiers. A childhood as a common criminal hardly prepared Sal for the trials. And as Sal succeeds in the competition, and wins the heart of Elise, an intriguing scribe at court, they start to dream of a new life and a different future, but one that Sal can have only if they survive.

Metchnikoff\\'s daring theory of immunity—that voracious cells he called phagocytes formed the first line of defense against invading bacteria—would eventually earn the scientist a Nobel Prize, shared with his archrival, as well as the unofficial moniker \"Father of Natural Immunity.\" But first he had to win over skeptics, especially those who called his theory \"an oriental fairy tale.\" Using previously inaccessible archival materials, author Luba Vikhanski chronicles Metchnikoff\\'s remarkable life and discoveries in the first moder n biography of this hero of medicine. Metchnikoff was a towering figure in the scientific community of the early twentieth century, a tireless humanitarian who, while working at the Pasteur Institute in Paris, also strived to curb the spread of cholera, syphilis, and other deadly diseases. In his later years, he startled the world with controversial theories on longevity, launching a global craze for yogurt, and pioneered research into gut microbes and aging. Though Metchnikoff was largely forgotten for nearly a hundred years, Vikhanski documents a remarkable revival of interest in his ideas on immunity and on the gut flora in the science of the twenty-first century.', 'industryIdentifiers': [{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9781613731130'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '1613731132'}], 'readingModes': {'text': True, 'image': True}, 'pageCount': 258, 'printType': 'BOOK', 'categories': ['Biography & Autobiography'], 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'allowAnonLogging': False, 'contentVersion': '1.5.4.0.preview.3', 'panelizationSummary': {'containsEpubBubbles': False, 'containsImageBubbles': False}, 'imageLinks': {'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=HL6bCwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=HL6bCwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}, 'language': 'en', 'previewLink': 'http://books.google.com/books?id=HL6bCwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Immunity:+How+Elie+Metchnikoff+Changed+the+Course+of+Modern+Medicine&hl=&as_pt=BOOKS&cd=1&source=gbs_api', 'infoLink': 'https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=HL6bCwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api', 'canonicalVolumeLink': 'https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=HL6bCwAAQBAJ'}\n",

But how can you pinpoint the exact behaviors that cause you to be miserable in the first place?

Despite the timeless wisdom of his teachings, many consider the book difficult to understand and daunting to read. In Don’t Be a Jerk, Zen priest and bestselling author Brad Warner, through accessible paraphrasing and incisive commentary, applies Dōgen’s teachings to modern times. While entertaining and sometimes irreverent, Warner is also an astute scholar who sees in Dōgen very modern psychological concepts, as well as insights on such topics as feminism and reincarnation. Warner even shows that Dōgen offered a “Middle Way” in the currently raging debate between science and religion. For curious readers worried that Dōgen’s teachings are too philosophically opaque, Don’t Be a Jerk is hilarious, understandable, and wise.', 'industryIdentifiers': [{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9781608683895'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '1608683893'}], 'readingModes': {'text': True, 'image': True}, 'pageCount': 328, 'printType': 'BOOK', 'categories': ['Religion'], 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'allowAnonLogging': True, 'contentVersion': '0.1.1.0.preview.3', 'panelizationSummary': {'containsEpubBubbles': False, 'containsImageBubbles': False}, 'imageLinks': {'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ErWRCwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ErWRCwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}, 'language': 'en', 'previewLink': 'http://books.google.com/books?id=ErWRCwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Don%27t+Be+a+Jerk:+And+Other+Practical+Advice+from+Dogen,+Japan%27s+Greatest+Zen+Master&hl=&as_pt=BOOKS&cd=1&source=gbs_api', 'infoLink': 'https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ErWRCwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api', 'canonicalVolumeLink': 'https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ErWRCwAAQBAJ'}\n",

Mary assumed duties as the island’s district nurse. Call the Nurse is her account of the enchanted years she and her family spent there, coming to know its folk as both patients and friends.

Everyone knows the legends about the cursed girl—Isabel, the one the señoras whisper about. They say she has green skin and grass for hair, and she feeds on the poisonous plants that fill her family’s lush Caribbean island garden. Some say she can grant wishes; some say her touch can kill. Seventeen-year-old Lucas spends summers with his hotel-developer father in Puerto Rico, and he’s grown up hearing the stories. When letters from the cursed girl mysteriously appear in his room the same day his girlfriend disappears, Lucas turns to Isabel for answers—and finds himself lured into her strange and enchanted world.

Many of us wrestle with the gap between our weaknesses and our dreams, between who we are and who God says we are meant to be. We feel unqualified to do God’s work or to live out the calling we imagine. But God has a way of using our weaknesses for good. In fact, God loves unqualified people. In (Un)Qualified, Pastor Steven Furtick helps you peel back the assumptions you’ve made about yourself and see yourself as God sees you. Because true peace and confidence come not from worldly perfection but from acceptance: God’s acceptance of you, your acceptance of yourself, and your acceptance of God’s process of change. This is a book about understanding your identity in light of who God is. It’s a book about coming to terms with the good, the bad, and the unmentionable in your life and learning to let God use you. It’s about charging into the gap between your present and your hopes and meeting God there. After all, God can’t bless who you pretend to be. But he longs to bless who you really are; a flawed and broken person. Good thing for us that God is in the business of using broken people to do big things. Being unqualified is God's favorite qualification... Our culture tells us that the answer to our failures is to fix them. The solution to our weaknesses is to hide them. The secret to our success is to appear as flawless as possible. But God’s qualifying system is different than the world’s. So is his view of our weaknesses, our purpose, and our true selves. In (Un)Qualified, Steven Furtick explores who God is as the great “I AM,” and then helps us discover our own identity. Delving into the story of Jacob, Furtick invites us to acknowledge our weaknesses and ask God to work through them. The truth is, God has created us to be more, to accomplish more, and to love life more than we ever thought possible. But to become who he has called us to be, we must embrace who we are right now. (Un)Qualified equips us to face obstacles and failures without losing a sense of purpose. We can have a thriving sense of hope that God is working in us and through us, not in spite of our weaknesses but often as a direct result of them.\", 'industryIdentifiers': [{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9781601424600'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '1601424604'}], 'readingModes': {'text': False, 'image': False}, 'pageCount': 226, 'printType': 'BOOK', 'categories': ['Religion'], 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'allowAnonLogging': False, 'contentVersion': '0.3.0.0.preview.0', 'panelizationSummary': {'containsEpubBubbles': False, 'containsImageBubbles': False}, 'imageLinks': {'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=2mVgDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=2mVgDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}, 'language': 'en', 'previewLink': 'http://books.google.com/books?id=2mVgDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=(Un)Qualified:+How+God+Uses+Broken+People+to+Do+Big+Things&hl=&as_pt=BOOKS&cd=1&source=gbs_api', 'infoLink': 'http://books.google.com/books?id=2mVgDwAAQBAJ&dq=(Un)Qualified:+How+God+Uses+Broken+People+to+Do+Big+Things&hl=&as_pt=BOOKS&source=gbs_api', 'canonicalVolumeLink': 'https://books.google.com/books/about/Un_Qualified.html?hl=&id=2mVgDwAAQBAJ'}\n",

Smith shows that who and what we worship fundamentally shape our hearts. And while we desire to shape culture, we are not often aware of how culture shapes us. We might not realize the ways our hearts are being taught to love rival gods instead of the One for whom we were made. Smith helps readers recognize the formative power of culture and the transformative possibilities of Christian practices. He explains that worship is the \"imagination station\" that incubates our loves and longings so that our cultural endeavors are indexed toward God and his kingdom. This is why the church and worshiping in a local community of believers should be the hub and heart of Christian formation and discipleship. Following the publication of his influential work Desiring the Kingdom, Smith received numerous requests from pastors and leaders for a more accessible version of that book\\'s content. No mere abridgment, this new book draws on years of Smith\\'s popular presentations on the ideas in Desiring the Kingdom to offer a fresh, bottom-up rearticulation.

This is the little-known story of how a newly independent nation was challenged by four Muslim powers and what happened when America's third president decided to stand up to intimidation. When Thomas Jefferson became president in 1801, America was deeply in debt and needed its economy to grow quickly, but its merchant ships were under attack. Pirates from North Africa routinely captured American sailors and held them as slaves, demanding ransom and tribute far beyond what the new country could afford. Jefferson found it impossible to negotiate with the leaders of the Barbary states, who believed their religion justified the plunder and enslavement of non-Muslims. These rogue states would show no mercy, so President Jefferson decided to move beyond diplomacy. He sent the U.S. Navy's new warships and a detachment of Marines to blockade Tripoli--launching the Barbary Wars and beginning America's journey toward future superpower status. As they did in George Washington's Secret Six, Kilmeade and Yaeger have transformed a nearly forgotten slice of history into a dramatic story that will keep you turning the pages to find out what happens next. Among the many suspenseful episodes: · Lieutenant Andrew Sterett's ferocious cannon battle on the high seas against the treacherous pirate ship Tripoli. · Lieutenant Stephen Decatur's daring night raid of an enemy harbor, with the aim of destroying an American ship that had fallen into the pirates' hands. · General William Eaton's 500-mile march from Egypt to the port of Derne, where the Marines launched a surprise attack and an American flag was raised in victory on foreign soil for the first time.\", 'industryIdentifiers': [{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9780143131830'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '0143131834'}], 'readingModes': {'text': False, 'image': False}, 'pageCount': 306, 'printType': 'BOOK', 'categories': ['History'], 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'allowAnonLogging': False, 'contentVersion': '0.2.0.0.preview.0', 'panelizationSummary': {'containsEpubBubbles': False, 'containsImageBubbles': False}, 'imageLinks': {'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=eBg3DwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=eBg3DwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}, 'language': 'en', 'previewLink': 'http://books.google.com/books?id=eBg3DwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Thomas+Jefferson+and+the+Tripoli+Pirates:+The+Forgotten+War+That+Changed+American+History&hl=&as_pt=BOOKS&cd=1&source=gbs_api', 'infoLink': 'http://books.google.com/books?id=eBg3DwAAQBAJ&dq=Thomas+Jefferson+and+the+Tripoli+Pirates:+The+Forgotten+War+That+Changed+American+History&hl=&as_pt=BOOKS&source=gbs_api', 'canonicalVolumeLink': 'https://books.google.com/books/about/Thomas_Jefferson_and_the_Tripoli_Pirates.html?hl=&id=eBg3DwAAQBAJ'}\n",

For the Posts, a two-week trip to the Balearic island of Mallorca with their extended family and friends is a celebration: Franny and Jim are observing their thirty-fifth wedding anniversary, and their daughter, Sylvia, has graduated from high school.

Defending the Regional Office is Sarah—who may or may not have a mechanical arm—fiercely devoted to the organization that took her in as a young woman in the wake of her mother’s sudden disappearance. On the day that the Regional Office is attacked, Rose’s and Sarah’s stories will overlap, their lives will collide, and the world as they know it just might end. Weaving in a brilliantly conceived mythology, fantastical magical powers, teenage crushes, and kinetic fight scenes, The Regional Office Is Under Attack! is a seismically entertaining debut novel about revenge and allegiance and love.', 'industryIdentifiers': [{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9780399573217'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '0399573216'}], 'readingModes': {'text': False, 'image': False}, 'pageCount': 418, 'printType': 'BOOK', 'categories': ['Fiction'], 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'allowAnonLogging': False, 'contentVersion': '0.4.0.0.preview.0', 'panelizationSummary': {'containsEpubBubbles': False, 'containsImageBubbles': False}, 'imageLinks': {'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=LzFSDgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=LzFSDgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}, 'language': 'en', 'previewLink': 'http://books.google.com/books?id=LzFSDgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=The+Regional+Office+Is+Under+Attack!&hl=&as_pt=BOOKS&cd=1&source=gbs_api', 'infoLink': 'http://books.google.com/books?id=LzFSDgAAQBAJ&dq=The+Regional+Office+Is+Under+Attack!&hl=&as_pt=BOOKS&source=gbs_api', 'canonicalVolumeLink': 'https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Regional_Office_Is_Under_Attack.html?hl=&id=LzFSDgAAQBAJ'}\n",

You probably passed one on the street today. These are people who have no empathy, who are manipulative, deceitful, charming, seductive, and delusional. This book is an exploration of their world and the madness industry. When Jon Ronson is drawn into an elaborate hoax played on some of the world's top scientists, his investigation leads him, unexpectedly, to psychopaths. He meets an influential psychologist who is convinced that many important business leaders and politicians are in fact high-flying, high-functioning psychopaths, and teaches Ronson how to spot them. Armed with these new abilities, Ronson meets a patient inside an asylum for the criminally insane who insists that he's sane, a mere run-of-the-mill troubled youth, not a psychopath -- a claim that might be only manipulation, and a sign of his psychopathy. He spends time with a death-squad leader institutionalized for mortgage fraud, and with a legendary CEO who took joy in shutting down factories and firing people. He delves into the history of psychopathy diagnosis and treatments, from LSD-fueled days-long naked therapy sessions in prisons to attempts to understand serial killers.\", 'industryIdentifiers': [{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9781594485756'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '1594485755'}], 'readingModes': {'text': False, 'image': False}, 'pageCount': 290, 'printType': 'BOOK', 'categories': ['Biography & Autobiography'], 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'allowAnonLogging': False, 'contentVersion': '0.1.0.0.preview.0', 'panelizationSummary': {'containsEpubBubbles': False, 'containsImageBubbles': False}, 'imageLinks': {'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=XkHZCwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=XkHZCwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}, 'language': 'en', 'previewLink': 'http://books.google.com/books?id=XkHZCwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=The+Psychopath+Test:+A+Journey+Through+the+Madness+Industry&hl=&as_pt=BOOKS&cd=1&source=gbs_api', 'infoLink': 'http://books.google.com/books?id=XkHZCwAAQBAJ&dq=The+Psychopath+Test:+A+Journey+Through+the+Madness+Industry&hl=&as_pt=BOOKS&source=gbs_api', 'canonicalVolumeLink': 'https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Psychopath_Test.html?hl=&id=XkHZCwAAQBAJ'}\n",

From the victim\\'s young husband and bitter stepsons to her family nurse, hired help and even a poison-specialist who just happens to be in the neighborhood. Everyone of them has secrets they are struggling to hide, but they are no match for the ingenious Poirot.

Following a series of strange occurrences, a second body is discovered, murdered with the same weapon. While the evidence lures local authorities to dead ends, Poirot, with the help of his \"little grey cells\" unravels the web of confusion, bringing to light a tale of secrets long hidden, blackmail, and forbidden love. Poirot Investigates (Hercule Poirot #3): Poirot Investigates a host of murders most foul-as well as other dastardly crimes-in this intriguing collection of short stories from the one-and-only Agatha Christie.

To high-born Adelaide, whose wealthy family is forcing her into a loveless marriage, the Glittering Court represents something else: the chance to chart her own destiny, and adventure in an unspoiled, prosperous new land across the sea. After a chance meeting with the dazzling Cedric Thorn, Adelaide poses as a servant to join the crop of impoverished girls he promises to transform into proper ladies. But her familiarity with upper class life comes with a price: she must hide her identity from her new friends, mysterious refugee Mira and fiery former laundress Tamsin, and most importantly, from Cedric himself—even though she’s falling in love with him. Everything begins to crumble when Cedric discovers Adelaide’s ruse, and she catches the eye of a powerful young governor, who wants her for a wife. She didn’t leave the gilded cage of her old life behind just to become someone else\\'s property. But nothing is as daunting—or as wonderful—as the potent, forbidden attraction simmering between Adelaide and Cedric.

When her unicorn dreams collide with his mulish plans, the battle for the heart and soul of a quaint Victorian inn begins. . . Jenny Turner needs to get her life together. She knows it, everyone knows it, and she’s going to do it. Soon. But one night when she catches her sometimes “boyfriend” cheating on her in the middle of a summer camping trip, she winds up at a quaint inn on the north shore of Lake Haven that it closed. This presents a problem. She can’t go home—her dad has a new woman in his life and doesn’t need Jenny’s help anymore. She can’t go to her friends—they are too eager to hook Jenny up with a job. With no place else to go, Jenny must convince the gruff but very hot innkeeper—who is wearing a kilt for some reason—to let her a stay a night. . .or ten. Edan Mackenzie is closing up shop and going home to Scotland. He came to America a few years ago to help a favorite aunt with her inn and to see part of the world. But he ended up working so much he saw nothing, his aunt died, his girlfriend left him, and suddenly, the usually pragmatic Edan doesn’t know who he was or what he’s doing with his life anymore. He’s come up with a firm plan and specific goals and has no patience for those who don’t do the same. But then a woman with shining blue eyes and long legs walks right past his CLOSED sign and into his life, and clearly has no idea what she’s doing. At first, Edan is mystified. But then he notices that chatty Jenny is starting to make sense in a weird way, and maybe her plans for getting her life together are perhaps better than his, and maybe this pretty, daffy woman is exactly what Edan needed all along. Just maybe, two people struggling to figure out where life will take them stumble into each other in the right cozy inn at the right time. . .

For the past three years, Jon Ronson has travelled the world meeting recipients of high-profile public shamings. The shamed are people like us - people who, say, made a joke on social media that came out badly, or made a mistake at work. Once their transgression is revealed, collective outrage circles with the force of a hurricane and the next thing they know they're being torn apart by an angry mob, jeered at, demonized, sometimes even fired from their job. A great renaissance of public shaming is sweeping our land. Justice has been democratized. The silent majority are getting a voice. But what are we doing with our voice? We are mercilessly finding people's faults. We are defining the boundaries of normality by ruining the lives of those outside it. We are using shame as a form of social control.

Bill Gates named Shoe Dog one of his five favorite books of the year and called it “an amazing tale, a refreshingly honest reminder of what the path to business success really looks like. It’s a messy, perilous, and chaotic journey, riddled with mistakes, endless struggles, and sacrifice. Phil Knight opens up in ways few CEOs are willing to do.” Fresh out of business school, Phil Knight borrowed fifty dollars from his father and launched a company with one simple mission: import high-quality, low-cost running shoes from Japan. Selling the shoes from the trunk of his car in 1963, Knight grossed eight thousand dollars that first year. Today, Nike’s annual sales top $30 billion. In this age of start-ups, Knight’s Nike is the gold standard, and its swoosh is one of the few icons instantly recognized in every corner of the world. But Knight, the man behind the swoosh, has always been a mystery. In Shoe Dog, he tells his story at last. At twenty-four, Knight decides that rather than work for a big corporation, he will create something all his own, new, dynamic, different. He details the many risks he encountered, the crushing setbacks, the ruthless competitors and hostile bankers—as well as his many thrilling triumphs. Above all, he recalls the relationships that formed the heart and soul of Nike, with his former track coach, the irascible and charismatic Bill Bowerman, and with his first employees, a ragtag group of misfits and savants who quickly became a band of swoosh-crazed brothers. Together, harnessing the electrifying power of a bold vision and a shared belief in the transformative power of sports, they created a brand—and a culture—that changed everything.', 'industryIdentifiers': [{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9781501135934'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '1501135937'}], 'readingModes': {'text': True, 'image': False}, 'pageCount': 368, 'printType': 'BOOK', 'categories': ['Biography & Autobiography'], 'averageRating': 4.5, 'ratingsCount': 7, 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'allowAnonLogging': True, 'contentVersion': '1.32.30.0.preview.2', 'panelizationSummary': {'containsEpubBubbles': False, 'containsImageBubbles': False}, 'imageLinks': {'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=wO3PCgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=wO3PCgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}, 'language': 'en', 'previewLink': 'http://books.google.com/books?id=wO3PCgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Shoe+Dog:+A+Memoir+by+the+Creator+of+NIKE&hl=&as_pt=BOOKS&cd=1&source=gbs_api', 'infoLink': 'https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=wO3PCgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api', 'canonicalVolumeLink': 'https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=wO3PCgAAQBAJ'}\n",

Distributed by Universal Pictures with a screenplay by Francine Rivers and D.J. Caruso. California’s gold country, 1850. A time when men sold their souls for a bag of gold and women sold their bodies for a place to sleep. Angel expects nothing from men but betrayal. Sold into prostitution as a child, she survives by keeping her hatred alive. And what she hates most are the men who use her, leaving her empty and dead inside. Then she meets Michael Hosea, a man who seeks his Father’s heart in everything. Michael obeys God’s call to marry Angel and to love her unconditionally. Slowly, day by day, he defies Angel’s every bitter expectation, until despite her resistance, her frozen heart begins to thaw. But with her unexpected softening comes overwhelming feelings of unworthiness and fear. And so Angel runs. Back to the darkness, away from her husband’s pursuing love, terrified of the truth she no longer can deny: her final healing must come from the One who loves her even more than Michael does . . . the One who will never let her go. A powerful retelling of the story of Gomer and Hosea, Redeeming Love is a life-changing story of God’s unconditional, redemptive, all-consuming love.

His poems are by turns graceful and wonderstruck. His lines are both long and short, his pose narrative and lyric, his diction formal and insouciant. From the outside, Vuong has fashioned a poetry of inclusion.”—The New Yorker \"Night Sky with Exit Wounds establishes Vuong as a fierce new talent to be reckoned with...This book is a masterpiece that captures, with elegance, the raw sorrows and joys of human existence.\"—Buzzfeed\\'s \"Most Exciting New Books of 2016\" \"This original, sprightly wordsmith of tumbling pulsing phrases pushes poetry to a new level...A stunning introduction to a young poet who writes with both assurance and vulnerability. Visceral, tender and lyrical, fleet and agile, these poems unflinchingly face the legacies of violence and cultural displacement but they also assume a position of wonder before the world.”—2016 Whiting Award citation \"Night Sky with Exit Wounds is the kind of book that soon becomes worn with love. You will want to crease every page to come back to it, to underline every other line because each word resonates with power.\"—LitHub \"Vuong’s powerful voice explores passion, violence, history, identity—all with a tremendous humanity.\"—Slate “In his impressive debut collection, Vuong, a 2014 Ruth Lilly fellow, writes beauty into—and culls from—individual, familial, and historical traumas. Vuong exists as both observer and observed throughout the book as he explores deeply personal themes such as poverty, depression, queer sexuality, domestic abuse, and the various forms of violence inflicted on his family during the Vietnam War. Poems float and strike in equal measure as the poet strives to transform pain into clarity. Managing this balance becomes the crux of the collection, as when he writes, ‘Your father is only your father/ until one of you forgets. Like how the spine/ won’t remember its wings/ no matter how many times our knees/ kiss the pavement.’”—Publishers Weekly \"What a treasure [Ocean Vuong] is to us. What a perfume he\\'s crushed and rendered of his heart and soul.

And yet John Quincy fell in love with her, almost despite himself. Their often tempestuous but deeply close marriage lasted half a century. They lived in Prussia, Massachusetts, Washington, Russia, and England, at royal courts, on farms, in cities, and in the White House. Louisa saw more of Europe and America than nearly any other woman of her time. But wherever she lived, she was always pressing her nose against the glass, not quite sure whether she was looking in or out. The other members of the Adams family could take their identity for granted—they were Adamses; they were Americans—but she had to invent her own. The story of Louisa Catherine Adams is one of a woman who forged a sense of self. As the country her husband led found its place in the world, she found a voice. That voice resonates still. In this deeply felt biography, the talented journalist and historian Louisa Thomas finally gives Louisa Catherine Adams's full extraordinary life its due. An intimate portrait of a remarkable woman, a complicated marriage, and a pivotal historical moment, Louisa Thomas's biography is a masterful work from an elegant storyteller.\", 'industryIdentifiers': [{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9780399563133'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '039956313X'}], 'readingModes': {'text': False, 'image': False}, 'pageCount': 514, 'printType': 'BOOK', 'categories': ['Biography & Autobiography'], 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'allowAnonLogging': False, 'contentVersion': '0.4.0.0.preview.0', 'panelizationSummary': {'containsEpubBubbles': False, 'containsImageBubbles': False}, 'imageLinks': {'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=pyxDDgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=pyxDDgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}, 'language': 'en', 'previewLink': 'http://books.google.com/books?id=pyxDDgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Louisa:+The+Extraordinary+Life+of+Mrs.+Adams&hl=&as_pt=BOOKS&cd=1&source=gbs_api', 'infoLink': 'http://books.google.com/books?id=pyxDDgAAQBAJ&dq=Louisa:+The+Extraordinary+Life+of+Mrs.+Adams&hl=&as_pt=BOOKS&source=gbs_api', 'canonicalVolumeLink': 'https://books.google.com/books/about/Louisa.html?hl=&id=pyxDDgAAQBAJ'}\n",

Mount Ararat is the most fabled mountain in the world. For millennia this massif in eastern Turkey has been rumored as the resting place of Noah’s Ark following the Great Flood. But it also plays a significant role in the longstanding conflict between Turkey and Armenia. Author Rick Antonson joined a five-member expedition to the mountain’s nearly 17,000-foot summit, trekking alongside a contingent of Armenians, for whom Mount Ararat is the stolen symbol of their country. Antonson weaves vivid historical anecdote with unexpected travel vignettes, whether tracing earlier mountaineering attempts on the peak, recounting the genocide of Armenians and its unresolved debate, or depicting the Kurds’ ambitions for their own nation’s borders, which some say should include Mount Ararat. What unfolds in Full Moon Over Noah’s Ark is one man’s odyssey, a tale told through many stories. Starting with the flooding of the Black Sea in 5600 BCE, through to the Epic of Gilgamesh and the contrasting narratives of the Great Flood known to followers of the Judaic, Christian and Islamic religions, Full Moon Over Noah’s Ark takes readers along with Antonson through the shadows and broad landscapes of Turkey, Iraq, Iran and Armenia, shedding light on a troubled but fascinating area of the world.

That's a mistake, says Daniel H. Pink (author of To Sell Is Human: The Surprising Truth About Motivating Others). In this provocative and persuasive new book, he asserts that the secret to high performance and satisfaction-at work, at school, and at home—is the deeply human need to direct our own lives, to learn and create new things, and to do better by ourselves and our world. Drawing on four decades of scientific research on human motivation, Pink exposes the mismatch between what science knows and what business does—and how that affects every aspect of life. He examines the three elements of true motivation—autonomy, mastery, and purpose-and offers smart and surprising techniques for putting these into action in a unique book that will change how we think and transform how we live.\", 'industryIdentifiers': [{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9781101524381'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '1101524383'}], 'readingModes': {'text': True, 'image': False}, 'pageCount': 272, 'printType': 'BOOK', 'categories': ['Business & Economics'], 'averageRating': 4.5, 'ratingsCount': 12, 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'allowAnonLogging': True, 'contentVersion': '2.12.13.0.preview.2', 'panelizationSummary': {'containsEpubBubbles': False, 'containsImageBubbles': False}, 'imageLinks': {'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=A-agLi2ldB4C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=A-agLi2ldB4C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}, 'language': 'en', 'previewLink': 'http://books.google.com/books?id=A-agLi2ldB4C&printsec=frontcover&dq=Drive:+The+Surprising+Truth+About+What+Motivates+Us&hl=&as_pt=BOOKS&cd=1&source=gbs_api', 'infoLink': 'https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=A-agLi2ldB4C&source=gbs_api', 'canonicalVolumeLink': 'https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=A-agLi2ldB4C'}\n",

'It is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles, or where the doer of deeds could have done them better. The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; . . . who at best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, and who at worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly' -Theodore Roosevelt Every time we are introduced to someone new, try to be creative, or start a difficult conversation, we take a risk. We feel uncertain and exposed. We feel vulnerable. Most of us try to fight those feelings - we strive to appear perfect. Challenging everything we think we know about vulnerability, Dr. Brené Brown dispels the widely accepted myth that it's a weakness. She argues that vulnerability is in fact a strength, and when we shut ourselves off from revealing our true selves we grow distanced from the things that bring purpose and meaning to our lives. Daring Greatly is the culmination of 12 years of groundbreaking social research, across the home, relationships, work, and parenting. It is an invitation to be courageous; to show up and let ourselves be seen, even when there are no guarantees. This is vulnerability. This is daring greatly. 'Brilliantly insightful. I can't stop thinking about this book' -Gretchen Rubin Brené Brown, Ph.D., LMSW is a #1 New York Times bestselling author and a research professor at the University of Houston Graduate College of Social Work. Her groundbreaking work was featured on Oprah Winfrey's Super Soul Sunday, NPR, and CNN. Her TED talk is one of the most watched TED talks of all time.

      "{'title': 'Becoming Wise', 'subtitle': 'An Inquiry into the Mystery and Art of Living', 'authors': ['Krista Tippett'], 'publisher': 'Penguin', 'publishedDate': '2016-04-05', 'description': \"“The discourse of our common life inclines towards despair. In my field of journalism, where we presume to write the first draft of history, we summon our deepest critical capacities for investigating what is inadequate, corrupt, catastrophic, and failing. The ‘news’ is defined as the extraordinary events of the day, but it is most often translated as the extraordinarily terrible events of the day. And in an immersive 24/7 news cycle, we internalize the deluge of bad news as the norm—the real truth of who we are and what we’re up against as a species. But my work has shown me that spiritual geniuses of the everyday are everywhere. They are in the margins and do not have publicists. They are below the radar, which is broken.” Peabody Award-winning broadcaster and National Humanities Medalist Krista Tippett has interviewed the most extraordinary voices examining the great questions of meaning for our time. The heart of her work on her national public radio program and podcast, On Being, has been to shine a light on people whose insights kindle in us a sense of wonder and courage. Scientists in a variety of fields; theologians from an array of faiths; poets, activists, and many others have all opened themselves up to Tippett's compassionate yet searching conversation. In Becoming Wise, Tippett distills the insights she has gleaned from this luminous conversation in its many dimensions into a coherent narrative journey, over time and from mind to mind. The book is a master class in living, curated by Tippett and accompanied by a delightfully ecumenical dream team of teaching faculty. The open questions and challenges of our time are intimate and civilizational all at once, Tippett says – definitions of when life begins and when death happens, of the meaning of community and family and identity, of our relationships to technology and through technology. The wisdom we seek emerges through the raw materials of the everyday. And the enduring question of what it means to be human has now become inextricable from the question of who we are to each other. This book offers a grounded and fiercely hopeful vision of humanity for this century – of personal growth but also renewed public life and human spiritual evolution. It insists on the possibility of a common life for this century marked by resilience and redemption, with beauty as a core moral value and civility and love as muscular practice. Krista Tippett's great gift, in her work and in Becoming Wise, is to avoid reductive simplifications but still find the golden threads that weave people and ideas together into a shimmering braid. One powerful common denominator of the lessons imparted to Tippett is the gift of presence, of the exhilaration of engagement with life for its own sake, not as a means to an end.

One in four Americans reject any affiliation with organized religion, and nearly half of those under thirty describe themselves as “spiritual but not religious.” But as the airwaves resound with the haranguing of preachers and pundits, who speaks for the millions who find no joy in whittling the wonder of existence to a simple yes/no choice? Lesley Hazleton does. In this provocative, brilliant book, she gives voice to the case for agnosticism, breaks it free of its stereotypes as watered-down atheism or amorphous “seeking,” and celebrates it as a reasoned, revealing, and sustaining stance toward life. Stepping over the lines imposed by rigid conviction, she draws on philosophy, theology, psychology, science, and more to explore, with curiosity and passion, the vital role of mystery in a deceptively information-rich world; to ask what we mean by the search for meaning; to invoke the humbling yet elating perspective of infinity; to challenge received ideas about death; and to reconsider what “the soul” might be.

Within decades after his death, his followers would call him God. Sifting through centuries of mythmaking, Reza Aslan sheds new light on one of history’s most enigmatic figures by examining Jesus through the lens of the tumultuous era in which he lived. Balancing the Jesus of the Gospels against the historical sources, Aslan describes a man full of conviction and passion, yet rife with contradiction. He explores the reasons the early Christian church preferred to promulgate an image of Jesus as a peaceful spiritual teacher rather than a politically conscious revolutionary. And he grapples with the riddle of how Jesus understood himself, the mystery that is at the heart of all subsequent claims about his divinity. Zealot yields a fresh perspective on one of the greatest stories ever told even as it affirms the radical and transformative nature of Jesus’ life and mission. Praise for Zealot “Riveting . . . Aslan synthesizes Scripture and scholarship to create an original account.”—The New Yorker “Fascinatingly and convincingly drawn . . . Aslan may come as close as one can to respecting those who revere Jesus as the peace-loving, turn-the-other-cheek, true son of God depicted in modern Christianity, even as he knocks down that image.”—The Seattle Times “[Aslan’s] literary talent is as essential to the effect of Zealot as are his scholarly and journalistic chops. . . . A vivid, persuasive portrait.”—Salon “This tough-minded, deeply political book does full justice to the real Jesus, and honors him in the process.”—San Francisco Chronicle “A special and revealing work, one that believer and skeptic alike will find surprising, engaging, and original.”—Jon Meacham, Pulitzer Prize–winning author of Thomas Jefferson: The Art of Power “Compulsively readable . . .

From the masterful minds of Grant Morrison (FINAL CRISIS, THE MULTIVERSITY) and Yanick Paquette (SWAMP THING, BATMAN, INC.) comes the most provocative origin of Wonder Woman you’ve ever seen--a wholly unique retelling that still honors her origins. For millennia, the Amazons of Paradise Island have created a thriving society away from the blight of man. One resident, however, is not satisfied with this secluded life--Diana, Princess of the Amazons, knows there is more in this world and wants to explore, only to be frustrated by her protective mother, Hippolyta. Diana finds her escape when Air Force pilot Steve Trevor, the first man she has ever seen, crashes onto their shores.

      "{'title': 'Unbroken (Movie Tie-in Edition)', 'subtitle': 'A World War II Story of Survival, Resilience, and Redemption', 'authors': ['Laura Hillenbrand'], 'publisher': 'Ballantine Books', 'publishedDate': '2018-08-21', 'description': '#1 NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER • The incredible true story of survival and salvation that is the basis for two major motion pictures: 2014’s Unbroken and the upcoming Unbroken: Path to Redemption. On a May afternoon in 1943, an Army Air Forces bomber crashed into the Pacific Ocean and disappeared, leaving only a spray of debris and a slick of oil, gasoline, and blood. Then, on the ocean surface, a face appeared. It was that of a young lieutenant, the plane’s bombardier, who was struggling to a life raft and pulling himself aboard. So began one of the most extraordinary odysseys of the Second World War. The lieutenant’s name was Louis Zamperini. In boyhood, he’d been a cunning and incorrigible delinquent, breaking into houses, brawling, and fleeing his home to ride the rails. As a teenager, he had channeled his defiance into running, discovering a prodigious talent that had carried him to the Berlin Olympics and within sight of the four-minute mile. But when war had come, the athlete had become an airman, embarking on a journey that led to his doomed flight, a tiny raft, and a drift into the unknown. Ahead of Zamperini lay thousands of miles of open ocean, leaping sharks, a foundering raft, thirst and starvation, enemy aircraft, and, beyond, a trial even greater. Driven to the limits of endurance, Zamperini would answer desperation with ingenuity; suffering with hope, resolve, and humor; brutality with rebellion. His fate, whether triumph or tragedy, would be suspended on the fraying wire of his will. In her long-awaited new book, Laura Hillenbrand writes with the same rich and vivid narrative voice she displayed in Seabiscuit. Telling an unforgettable story of a man’s journey into extremity, Unbroken is a testament to the resilience of the human mind, body, and spirit.

On a winter day in 1903, in the Outer Banks of North Carolina, two brothers—bicycle mechanics from Dayton, Ohio—changed history. But it would take the world some time to believe that the age of flight had begun, with the first powered machine carrying a pilot. Orville and Wilbur Wright were men of exceptional courage and determination, and of far-ranging intellectual interests and ceaseless curiosity. When they worked together, no problem seemed to be insurmountable. Wilbur was unquestionably a genius. Orville had such mechanical ingenuity as few had ever seen. That they had no more than a public high school education and little money never stopped them in their mission to take to the air. Nothing did, not even the self-evident reality that every time they took off, they risked being killed. In this “enjoyable, fast-paced tale” (The Economist), master historian David McCullough “shows as never before how two Ohio boys from a remarkable family taught the world to fly” (The Washington Post) and “captures the marvel of what the Wrights accomplished” (The Wall Street Journal). He draws on the extensive Wright family papers to profile not only the brothers but their sister, Katharine, without whom things might well have gone differently for them. Essential reading, this is “a story of timeless importance, told with uncommon empathy and fluency…about what might be the most astonishing feat mankind has ever accomplished…The Wright Brothers soars” (The New York Times Book Review).', 'industryIdentifiers': [{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9781476728766'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '1476728763'}], 'readingModes': {'text': True, 'image': False}, 'pageCount': 336, 'printType': 'BOOK', 'categories': ['Biography & Autobiography'], 'averageRating': 4, 'ratingsCount': 1, 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'allowAnonLogging': True, 'contentVersion': '2.49.34.0.preview.2', 'panelizationSummary': {'containsEpubBubbles': False, 'containsImageBubbles': False}, 'imageLinks': {'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=bLudBAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=bLudBAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}, 'language': 'en', 'previewLink': 'http://books.google.com/books?id=bLudBAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=The+Wright+Brothers&hl=&as_pt=BOOKS&cd=1&source=gbs_api', 'infoLink': 'https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=bLudBAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api', 'canonicalVolumeLink': 'https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=bLudBAAAQBAJ'}\n",

Growing up on idyllic St. Thomas in the early 1800s, Rachel dreams of life in faraway Paris. Rachel’s mother, a pillar of their small refugee community of Jews who escaped the Inquisition, has never forgiven her daughter for being a difficult girl who refuses to live by the rules. Growing up, Rachel’s salvation is their maid Adelle’s belief in her strengths, and her deep, life-long friendship with Jestine, Adelle’s daughter. But Rachel’s life is not her own. She is married off to a widower with three children to save her father’s business. When her older husband dies suddenly and his handsome, much younger nephew, Frédérick, arrives from France to settle the estate, Rachel seizes her own life story, beginning a defiant, passionate love affair that sparks a scandal that affects all of her family, including her favorite son, who will become one of the greatest artists of France. “A work of art” (Dallas Morning News), The Marriage of Opposites showcases the beloved, bestselling Alice Hoffman at the height of her considerable powers. “Her lush, seductive prose, and heart-pounding subject…make this latest skinny-dip in enchanted realism…the Platonic ideal of the beach read” (Slate.com).

      "{'title': 'The Lucifer Effect', 'subtitle': 'Understanding How Good People Turn Evil', 'authors': ['Philip Zimbardo'], 'publisher': 'Random House Trade Paperbacks', 'publishedDate': '2008-01-22', 'description': 'The definitive firsthand account of the groundbreaking research of Philip Zimbardo—the basis for the award-winning film The Stanford Prison Experiment Renowned social psychologist and creator of the Stanford Prison Experiment Philip Zimbardo explores the mechanisms that make good people do bad things, how moral people can be seduced into acting immorally, and what this says about the line separating good from evil. The Lucifer Effect explains how—and the myriad reasons why—we are all susceptible to the lure of “the dark side.” Drawing on examples from history as well as his own trailblazing research, Zimbardo details how situational forces and group dynamics can work in concert to make monsters out of decent men and women. Here, for the first time and in detail, Zimbardo tells the full story of the Stanford Prison Experiment, the landmark study in which a group of college-student volunteers was randomly divided into “guards” and “inmates” and then placed in a mock prison environment. Within a week the study was abandoned, as ordinary college students were transformed into either brutal, sadistic guards or emotionally broken prisoners. By illuminating the psychological causes behind such disturbing metamorphoses, Zimbardo enables us to better understand a variety of harrowing phenomena, from corporate malfeasance to organized genocide to how once upstanding American soldiers came to abuse and torture Iraqi detainees in Abu Ghraib. He replaces the long-held notion of the “bad apple” with that of the “bad barrel”—the idea that the social setting and the system contaminate the individual, rather than the other way around. This is a book that dares to hold a mirror up to mankind, showing us that we might not be who we think we are. While forcing us to reexamine what we are capable of doing when caught up in the crucible of behavioral dynamics, though, Zimbardo also offers hope. We are capable of resisting evil, he argues, and can even teach ourselves to act heroically. Like Hannah Arendt’s Eichmann in Jerusalem and Steven Pinker’s The Blank Slate, The Lucifer Effect is a shocking, engrossing study that will change the way we view human behavior. Praise for The Lucifer Effect “The Lucifer Effect will change forever the way you think about why we behave the way we do—and, in particular, about the human potential for evil. This is a disturbing book, but one that has never been more necessary.”—Malcolm Gladwell “An important book . . . All politicians and social commentators . . . should read this.”—The Times (London) “Powerful . . . an extraordinarily valuable addition to the literature of the psychology of violence or ‘evil.’”—The American Prospect “Penetrating . . . Combining a dense but readable and often engrossing exposition of social psychology research with an impassioned moral seriousness, Zimbardo challenges readers to look beyond glib denunciations of evil-doers and ponder our collective responsibility for the world’s ills.”—Publishers Weekly “A sprawling discussion . . . Zimbardo couples a thorough narrative of the Stanford Prison Experiment with an analysis of the social dynamics of the Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq.”—Booklist “Zimbardo bottled evil in a laboratory. The lessons he learned show us our dark nature but also fill us with hope if we heed their counsel.

Her name was Henrietta Lacks, but scientists know her as HeLa. She was a poor Southern tobacco farmer who worked the same land as her slave ancestors, yet her cells--taken without her knowledge--became one of the most important tools in medicine. The first \"immortal\" human cells grown in culture, they are still alive today, though she has been dead for more than sixty years. If you could pile all HeLa cells ever grown onto a scale, they\\'d weigh more than 50 million metric tons--as much as a hundred Empire State Buildings. HeLa cells were vital for developing the polio vaccine; uncovered secrets of cancer, viruses, and the atom bomb\\'s effects; helped lead to important advances like in vitro fertilization, cloning, and gene mapping; and have been bought and sold by the billions. Yet Henrietta Lacks remains virtually unknown, buried in an unmarked grave. Now Rebecca Skloot takes us on an extraordinary journey, from the \"colored\" ward of Johns Hopkins Hospital in the 1950s to stark white laboratories with freezers full of HeLa cells; from Henrietta\\'s small, dying hometown of Clover, Virginia--a land of wooden slave quarters, faith healings, and voodoo--to East Baltimore today, where her children and grandchildren live and struggle with the legacy of her cells. Henrietta\\'s family did not learn of her \"immortality\" until more than twenty years after her death, when scientists investigating HeLa began using her husband and children in research without informed consent. And though the cells had launched a multimillion-dollar industry that sells human biological materials, her family never saw any of the profits. As Rebecca Skloot so brilliantly shows, the story of the Lacks family--past and present--is inextricably connected to the dark history of experimentation on African Americans, the birth of bioethics, and the legal battles over whether we control the stuff we are made of. Over the decade it took to uncover this story, Rebecca became enmeshed in the lives of the Lacks family--especially Henrietta\\'s daughter Deborah, who was devastated to learn about her mother\\'s cells. She was consumed with questions: Had scientists cloned her mother? Did it hurt her when researchers infected her cells with viruses and shot them into space? What happened to her sister, Elsie, who died in a mental institution at the age of fifteen? And if her mother was so important to medicine, why couldn\\'t her children afford health insurance?

The Dovekeepers is “striking….Hoffman grounds her expansive, intricately woven, and deepest new novel in biblical history, with a devotion and seriousness of purpose” (Entertainment Weekly). Nearly two thousand years ago, nine hundred Jews held out for months against armies of Romans on Masada, a mountain in the Judean desert. According to the ancient historian Josephus, two women and five children survived. Based on this tragic and iconic event, Hoffman’s novel is a spellbinding tale of four extraordinarily bold, resourceful, and sensuous women, each of whom has come to Masada by a different path. Yael’s mother died in childbirth, and her father, an expert assassin, never forgave her for that death. Revka, a village baker’s wife, watched the murder of her daughter by Roman soldiers; she brings to Masada her young grandsons, rendered mute by what they have witnessed. Aziza is a warrior’s daughter, raised as a boy, a fearless rider and expert marksman who finds passion with a fellow soldier. Shirah, born in Alexandria, is wise in the ways of ancient magic and medicine, a woman with uncanny insight and power. The lives of these four complex and fiercely independent women intersect in the desperate days of the siege.

As a forensic investigator for the Cleveland Police Department, Maggie Gardiner has seen her share of Jane Does. The latest is an unidentified female in her early teens, discovered in a local cemetery. More shocking than the girl’s injuries—for Maggie at least—is the fact that no one has reported her missing. She and the detectives assigned to the case (including her cop ex-husband) are determined to follow every lead, run down every scrap of evidence. But the monster they seek is watching every move, closer to them than they could possibly imagine. Jack Renner is a killer.

First, there’s his new “solar flare” power, which releases tremendous amounts of energy but leaves him functionally human-fragile, vulnerable, prone to hangovers-for 24 hours.But an even bigger change is coming. A new company called Hordr has sprung up, and its business is secrets. If you have one that you want to keep hidden, Hordr can control you-and no one has a bigger secret than Clark Kent.

Between the two is a wry and knowing portrait of Rebecca Winter, a photographer whose work made her an unlikely heroine for many women. Her career is now descendent, her bank balance shaky, and she has fled the city for the middle of nowhere. There she discovers, in a tree stand with a roofer named Jim Bates, that what she sees through a camera lens is not all there is to life. Brilliantly written, powerfully observed, Still Life with Bread Crumbs is a deeply moving and often very funny story of unexpected love, and a stunningly crafted journey into the life of a woman, her heart, her mind, her days, as she discovers that life is a story with many levels, a story that is longer and more exciting than she ever imagined.

Chicken eggs that haven't come from chickens, melamine in infant's milk in China, nut shells in spices – these are just some examples of the food fraud that has occurred in recent years. As our urban lifestyle takes us further and further away from our food sources, there are increasing opportunities for dishonesty, duplicity and profit-making short-cuts. Food adulteration, motivated by money, is an issue that has spanned the globe throughout human history. Whether it's a matter of making a good quality oil stretch a bit further by adding a little extra 'something' or labelling a food falsely to appeal to current consumer trends – it's all food fraud, and it costs the food industry billions of dollars each year. The price to consumers may be even higher, with some paying for these crimes with their health and, in some cases, their lives. Sorting the Beef from the Bull is a collection of food fraud tales from around the world. It explains the role of science in uncovering some of the century's biggest food scams, and explores the arms race between food forensics and fraudsters as new methods of detection spur more creative and sophisticated means of committing the crimes.

Ben Jewell has hit a breaking point. His profoundly autistic ten-year-old son, Jonah, has never spoken, and Ben and his wife Emma are struggling to cope. When Ben and Emma fake a separation—a strategic yet ill-advised decision to further Jonah’s case in an upcoming tribunal to determine the future of his education—father and son are forced to move in with Georg, Ben’s elderly and cantankerous father. In a small house in north London, three generations of men—one who can’t talk; two who won’t—are thrown together.

Yet trade routes were established, alliances built and empires secured – all for something that filled the oceans, bubbled up from springs, formed crusts in lake beds, and thickly veined a large part of the Earth’s rock fairly close to the surface. From pre-history until just a century ago – when the mysteries of salt were revealed by modern chemistry and geology – no one knew that salt was virtually everywhere. Accordingly, it was one of the most sought-after commodities in human history. Even today, salt is a major industry. Canada, Kurlansky tells us, is the world’s sixth largest salt producer, with salt works in Ontario playing a major role in satisfying the Americans’ insatiable demand.

He is a world-class hero, a larger-than-life figurehead, best known of a generation of astronauts whose achievements surged in just a few years from first man in space to first men on the moon.

No Dream Is Too High whittles down Buzz Aldrin's event-filled life into a short list of principles he values, each illustrated by fascinating anecdotes and memories, such as: · Second comes right after first. NASA protocol should have meant he was first on the moon, but rules changed just before the mission. How he learned to be proud of being the second man on the moon. · Look for opportunities, not obstacles. Buzz was rejected the first time he applied to be an astronaut. Failure is an opportunity to learn to do better. · Always maintain your spirit of adventure. For his 80th birthday, Buzz went diving in the Galapagos and hitched a ride on a whale shark.

Meanwhile, people with important ideas—entrepreneurs, teachers, politicians, and journalists—struggle to make them “stick.” In Made to Stick, Chip and Dan Heath reveal the anatomy of ideas that stick and explain ways to make ideas stickier, such as applying the human scale principle, using the Velcro Theory of Memory, and creating curiosity gaps. Along the way, we discover that sticky messages of all kinds—from the infamous “kidney theft ring” hoax to a coach’s lessons on sportsmanship to a vision for a new product at Sony—draw their power from the same six traits. Made to Stick will transform the way you communicate. It’s a fast-paced tour of success stories (and failures): the Nobel Prize-winning scientist who drank a glass of bacteria to prove a point about stomach ulcers; the charities who make use of the Mother Teresa Effect; the elementary-school teacher whose simulation actually prevented racial prejudice.

But behind that veneer of perfection lies a vulnerability that Ani holds close and buries deep--a very violent and public trauma from her past that has left her constantly trying to reinvent herself. And only she knows how far she would go to keep her secrets safe. When a documentary producer invites Ani to tell her side of the chilling incident that took place when she was a teenager at the prestigious Bradley School, she hopes it will be an opportunity for public vindication.

Lady Midnight is a Shadowhunters novel. It’s been five years since the events of City of Heavenly Fire that brought the Shadowhunters to the brink of oblivion. Emma Carstairs is no longer a child in mourning, but a young woman bent on discovering who killed her parents and avenging her losses. Together with her battle partner Julian Blackthorn, Emma must learn to trust her head and her heart as she investigates a demonic plot that stretches across Los Angeles, from the Sunset Strip to the enchanted sea that pounds the beaches of Santa Monica. If only her heart didn’t lead her in treacherous directions… Making things even more complicated, Julian’s brother Mark—who was captured by the faeries five years ago—has been returned as a bargaining chip. The faeries are desperate to find out who is murdering their kind—and they need the Shadowhunters’ help to do it. But time works differently in faerie, so Mark has barely aged and doesn’t recognize his family. Can he ever truly return to them? Will the faeries really allow it?

This full-color, beautifully illustrated edition features more than fifty percent new content, with ten never-before-seen essays and one wholly revised and expanded piece as well as classics from the website like, “The God of Cake,” “Dogs Don’t Understand Basic Concepts Like Moving,” and her astonishing, “Adventures in Depression,” and “Depression Part Two,” which have been hailed as some of the most insightful meditations on the disease ever written.

Lin-Manuel Miranda\\'s groundbreaking musical Hamilton is as revolutionary as its subject, the poor kid from the Caribbean who fought the British, defended the Constitution, and helped to found the United States. Fusing hip-hop, pop, R&B, and the best traditions of theater, this once-in-a-generation show broadens the sound of Broadway, reveals the storytelling power of rap, and claims our country\\'s origins for a diverse new generation. Hamilton: The Revolution gives readers an unprecedented view of both revolutions, from the only two writers able to provide it. Miranda, along with Jeremy McCarter, a cultural critic and theater artist who was involved in the project from its earliest stages -- \"since before this was even a show,\" according to Miranda -- traces its development from an improbable performance at the White House to its landmark opening night on Broadway six years later. In addition, Miranda has written more than 200 funny, revealing footnotes for his award-winning libretto, the full text of which is published here. Their account features photos by the renowned Frank Ockenfels and veteran Broadway photographer, Joan Marcus; exclusive looks at notebooks and emails; interviews with Questlove, Stephen Sondheim, leading political commentators, and more than 50 people involved with the production; and multiple appearances by President Obama himself.

      "{'title': 'Greek Mythology', 'subtitle': 'The Ancient Myths and Legends of Greek Mythology', 'authors': ['Patrick Auerbach'], 'publisher': 'Createspace Independent Publishing Platform', 'publishedDate': '2016-06-07', 'description': \"Greek Mythology is the body of myths and teachings that belong to the ancient Greeks, concerning their gods and heroes, the nature of the world, and the origins and significance of their own cult and ritual practices. It was a part of the religion in ancient Greece. The Greeks were polytheistic in their religious beliefs. Polytheistic means they believed in and worshiped many different gods. Modern scholars refer to and study the myths in an attempt to shed light on the religious and political institutions of Ancient Greece and its civilization, and to gain understanding of the nature of myth-making itself. In Greek Mythology, the gods often represented different forms of nature. Their religion/mythology had no formal structure with the exception of various festivals held in honor of the gods. There was no sacred book or code of conduct to live by. The most powerful Greek gods were known as the Olympians. The Greeks believed the Olympians lived on the highest mountain in Greece, Mount Olympus. The Olympian gods included: Zeus, Hera, Apollo, Aphrodite, Ares, Artemis, Athena, Demeter, Hades, Hermes, Hephaestus, Poseidon and Hestia or later she was replaced in some lists by Dionysus. Greek Mythology is explicitly embodied in a large collection of narratives, and implicitly in Greek representational arts, such as vase-paintings and votive gifts. Greek myth attempts to explain the origins of the world, and details the lives and adventures of a wide variety of gods, goddesses, heroes, heroines and mythological creatures.

Glory Over Everything is “gripping…breathless until the end” (Kirkus Reviews). The year is 1830 and Jamie Pyke, a celebrated silversmith and notorious ladies’ man, is keeping a deadly secret. Passing as a wealthy white aristocrat in Philadelphian society, Jamie is now living a life he could never have imagined years before when he was a runaway slave, son of a southern black slave and her master. But Jamie’s carefully constructed world is threatened when he discovers that his married socialite lover, Caroline, is pregnant and his beloved servant Pan, to whose father Jamie owes his own freedom, has been captured and sold into slavery in the South. Fleeing the consequences of his deceptions, Jamie embarks on a trip to a North Carolina plantation to save Pan from the life he himself barely escaped as a boy. With the help of a fearless slave, Sukey, who has taken the terrified young boy under her wing, Jamie navigates their way, racing against time and their ruthless pursuers through the Virginia backwoods, the Underground Railroad, and the treacherous Great Dismal Swamp. “Kathleen Grissom is a first-rate storyteller…she observes with an unwavering but kind eye, and she bestows upon the reader, amid terrible secrets and sin, a gift of mercy: the belief that hope can triumph over hell” (Richmond Times Dispatch).

Far and Away chronicles Andrew Solomon’s writings about places undergoing seismic shifts—political, cultural, and spiritual. From his stint on the barricades in Moscow in 1991, when he joined artists in resisting the coup whose failure ended the Soviet Union, his 2002 account of the rebirth of culture in Afghanistan following the fall of the Taliban, his insightful appraisal of a Myanmar seeped in contradictions as it slowly, fitfully pushes toward freedom, and many other stories of profound upheaval, this book provides a unique window onto the very idea of social change. With his signature brilliance and compassion, Solomon demonstrates both how history is altered by individuals, and how personal identities are altered when governments alter. A journalist and essayist of remarkable perception and prescience, Solomon captures the essence of these cultures. Ranging across seven continents and twenty-five years, these “meaty dispatches…are brilliant geopolitical travelogues that also comprise a very personal and reflective resume of the National Book Award winner’s globe-trotting adventures” (Elle). Far and Away takes a magnificent journey into the heart of extraordinarily diverse experiences: “You will not only know the world better after having seen it through Solomon’s eyes, you will also care about it more” (Elizabeth Gilbert).', 'industryIdentifiers': [{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9781476795065'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '1476795061'}], 'readingModes': {'text': True, 'image': False}, 'pageCount': 640, 'printType': 'BOOK', 'categories': ['Social Science'], 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'allowAnonLogging': True, 'contentVersion': '1.17.11.0.preview.2', 'panelizationSummary': {'containsEpubBubbles': False, 'containsImageBubbles': False}, 'imageLinks': {'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=S1UJCgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=S1UJCgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}, 'language': 'en', 'previewLink': 'http://books.google.com/books?id=S1UJCgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Far+%26+Away:+Places+on+the+Brink+of+Change:+Seven+Continents,+Twenty-Five+Years&hl=&as_pt=BOOKS&cd=1&source=gbs_api', 'infoLink': 'https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=S1UJCgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api', 'canonicalVolumeLink': 'https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=S1UJCgAAQBAJ'}\n",

Eligible, Curtis Sittenfeld’s newest novel, is “a modern retelling of Pride and Prejudice.” In this twenty-first century tale, the girls of the Bennet family keep some core traits from the Jane Austen originals, but with a modern take. Jane is a Yoga instructor about to turn forty, Liz is in her late thirties and is a magazine writer who lives in New York City, Mary is all about her online degrees, and Kitty and Lydia are still the youngest and spoiled ones who now are obsessed with Paleo diets and CrossFit. This time, the two eldest sisters came back to the family house to help with their father’s recovery from a heart scare. Since all the girls are back home, Mrs. Bennet takes the opportunity to seek potential husbands for her daughters, and what better than a Fourth of July barbecue where Dr. Chip Bingley—a recent contestant of the TV dating show Eligible- is presented, accompanied by his sister and his school friend, Dr. Fitzwilliam Darcy. Taking the characteristic humor from Jane Austen’s original, Curtis Sittenfeld made a transition from the countryside of England in the early 1800s to the modern society of Cincinnati.

There are secrets you share, and secrets you hide… What if your beloved fiancé, he of the crinkly smile and irresistible British accent, had kept a life-changing secret from you? And what if, just a week before your dream wedding, you discovered it? Georgia Ford, bride-to-be, hops in her car and drives through the night, from Los Angeles to Sonoma, to her safe haven: her family, and the acclaimed family winery. Georgia craves the company of those who know her best, and whom she truly knows. Better yet, it’s the eve of the last harvest—the best time of the growing season, and Georgia knows she’ll find solace—and distraction—in the familiar rituals. But when Georgia arrives home, nothing is at all familiar. Her parents, her brothers, the family business, are all unrecognizable.

Will their long-distance friendship unlock her heart? Sam is, to say the least, bookish. An English major of the highest order, her diet has always been Austen, Dickens, and Shakespeare. The problem is that both her prose and conversation tend to be more Elizabeth Bennet than Samantha Moore. But life for the twenty-three-year-old orphan is about to get stranger than fiction. An anonymous, Dickensian benefactor calling himself Mr. Knightley offers to put Sam through Northwestern University’s prestigious Medill School of Journalism. There is only one catch: Sam must write frequent letters to the mysterious donor, detailing her progress. Sam’s letters to Mr. Knightley become increasingly confessional as she begins to share everything from her painful childhood memories to her growing feelings for eligible novelist Alex Powell. While Alex draws Sam into a world of warmth and literature that feels like it’s straight out of a book, old secrets are drawn to light. And as Sam learns to love and trust Alex and herself, she learns once again how quickly trust can be broken. Reminding us all that our own true character is not meant to be hidden, Katherine Reay’s debut novel follows a young woman’s journey as she sheds her protective persona and embraces the person she was meant to become.

Yes, rather than becoming immune to them, we are rapidly embracing brands. Profiling Timberland, American Apparel, Pabst Blue Ribbon, Red Bull, iPod, and Livestrong, among others, Walker demonstrates the ways in which buyers adopt products not just as consumer choices but as conscious expressions of their identities.

Though I would have moments of lucidity over the coming days and weeks, I would never again be the same person ...' Susannah Cahalan was a happy, clever, healthy twenty-four-year old. Then one day she woke up in hospital, with no memory of what had happened or how she had got there. Within weeks, she would be transformed into someone unrecognizable, descending into a state of acute psychosis, undergoing rages and convulsions, hallucinating that her father had murdered his wife; that she could control time with her mind. Everything she had taken for granted about her life, and who she was, was wiped out. Brain on Fire is Susannah's story of her terrifying descent into madness and the desperate hunt for a diagnosis, as, after dozens of tests and scans, baffled doctors concluded she should be confined in a psychiatric ward. It is also the story of how one brilliant man, Syria-born Dr Najar, finally proved - using a simple pen and paper - that Susannah's psychotic behaviour was caused by a rare autoimmune disease attacking her brain. His diagnosis of this little-known condition, thought to have been the real cause of devil-possessions through history, saved her life, and possibly the lives of many others. Cahalan takes readers inside this newly-discovered disease through the progress of her own harrowing journey, piecing it together using memories, journals, hospital videos and records. Written with passionate honesty and intelligence, Brain on Fire is a searingly personal yet universal book, which asks what happens when your identity is suddenly destroyed, and how you get it back. 'With eagle-eye precision and brutal honesty, Susannah Cahalan turns her journalistic gaze on herself as she bravely looks back on one of the most harrowing and unimaginable experiences one could ever face: the loss of mind, body and self.

Reggie Riot is no one’s idea of a cultural savior. The latchkey child of a busy single mother, he’s grown up to be a resentful slacker whose idea of high culture is getting stoned and admiring the graffiti in the alley where he scores his weed. His mother, however, is not your average working parent. She’s the head of a secret organization called Art Ops, whose mission is protecting the artistic treasures of the world—which have a lot more life in them than a casual observer might realize. Reggie has always shunned his mom’s high-culture scene, but a devastating encounter with the shadowy forces menacing the world’s masterpieces has left him with a permanent expression of the chaotic power of art flowing through his veins. So when Art Ops suddenly vanishes without a trace, leaving its final rescue—LA GIOCONDA, the Mona Lisa herself—out in the cold, it’s up to Reggie and his motley crew (including a masked super-powered operative who writes sitcom scripts on spec, a girls-just-wanna-have-fun ’80s music video icon, and a suburban clerk from a mall-punk clothing chain) to come to the rescue.

Marie-Laure lives with her father in Paris near the Museum of Natural History where he works as the master of its thousands of locks. When she is six, Marie-Laure goes blind and her father builds a perfect miniature of their neighborhood so she can memorize it by touch and navigate her way home.

In a mining town in Germany, the orphan Werner grows up with his younger sister, enchanted by a crude radio they find. Werner becomes an expert at building and fixing these crucial new instruments, a talent that wins him a place at a brutal academy for Hitler Youth, then a special assignment to track the Resistance.

Known for its lively, clear prose as well as its scholarly research, A People's History is the only volume to tell America's story from the point of view of -- and in the words of -- America's women, factory workers, African-Americans, Native Americans, the working poor, and immigrant laborers. As historian Howard Zinn shows, many of our country's greatest battles -- the fights for a fair wage, an eight-hour workday, child-labor laws, health and safety standards, universal suffrage, women's rights, racial equality -- were carried out at the grassroots level, against bloody resistance. Covering Christopher Columbus's arrival through President Clinton's first term, A People's History of the United States, which was nominated for the American Book Award in 1981, features insightful analysis of the most important events in our history.

Meet Ove. He’s a curmudgeon—the kind of man who points at people he dislikes as if they were burglars caught outside his bedroom window. He has staunch principles, strict routines, and a short fuse. People call him “the bitter neighbor from hell.” But must Ove be bitter just because he doesn’t walk around with a smile plastered to his face all the time? Behind the cranky exterior there is a story and a sadness. So when one November morning a chatty young couple with two chatty young daughters move in next door and accidentally flatten Ove’s mailbox, it is the lead-in to a comical and heartwarming tale of unkempt cats, unexpected friendship, and the ancient art of backing up a U-Haul. All of which will change one cranky old man and a local residents’ association to their very foundations.

Granting her subjects their loyalties, treacheries, and guilty passions, Tuchman re-creates the lives of proud cardinals, university scholars, grocers and clerks, saints and mystics, lawyers and mercenaries, and, dominating all, the knight—in all his valor and “furious follies,” a “terrible worm in an iron cocoon.” Praise for A Distant Mirror “Beautifully written, careful and thorough in its scholarship . . .

No one was more stunned by this unexpected turn of events than its beloved editor in chief, Ruth Reichl, who suddenly faced an uncertain professional future. As she struggled to process what had seemed unthinkable, Reichl turned to the one place that had always provided sanctuary. “I did what I always do when I’m confused, lonely, or frightened,” she writes. “I disappeared into the kitchen.” My Kitchen Year follows the change of seasons—and Reichl’s emotions—as she slowly heals through the simple pleasures of cooking. While working 24/7, Reichl would “throw quick meals together” for her family and friends. Now she has the time to rediscover what cooking meant to her. Imagine kale, leaves dark and inviting, sautéed with chiles and garlic; summer peaches baked into a simple cobbler; fresh oysters chilling in a box of snow; plump chickens and earthy mushrooms, fricasseed with cream. Over the course of this challenging year, each dish Reichl prepares becomes a kind of stepping stone to finding joy again in ordinary things. The 136 recipes collected here represent a life’s passion for food: a blistering ma po tofu that shakes Reichl out of the blues; a decadent grilled cheese sandwich that accompanies a rare sighting in the woods around her home; a rhubarb sundae that signals the arrival of spring. Here, too, is Reichl’s enlivening dialogue with her Twitter followers, who become her culinary supporters and lively confidants. Part cookbook, part memoir, part paean to the household gods, My Kitchen Year may be Ruth Reichl’s most stirring book yet—one that reveals a refreshingly vulnerable side of the world's most famous food editor as she shares treasured recipes to be returned to again and again and again. Praise for My Kitchen Year “Ruth is one of our greatest storytellers today, which you will feel from the moment you open this book and begin to read: No one writes as warmly and engagingly about the all-important intersection of food, life, love, and loss. This book is a lyrical and deeply intimate journey told through recipes, as only Ruth can do.”—Alice Waters “What will send this book to the top of bestseller lists is the lovely way Reichl describes how dishes come together, like the Greek chicken soup with lemon and egg known as avgolemono, and her talent for assembling a collection of recipes her legions of former Gourmet fans will want to make themselves.”—The Washington Post “The recipes make for lovely reading, full of Reichl’s elemental wisdom. . . . In the best way possible, My Kitchen Year is cozy, the reading equivalent of curling up next to a fire with a glass of red wine and perhaps the scent of bread in the oven wafting over.”—Vogue “If anyone can convince us that a dessert, plus two more fabulous dishes, can turn a crummy day around, it’s culinary writer Ruth Reichl, who knows firsthand just how powerful food can be.”—O: The Oprah Magazine “The voice is pure Reichl in a way that makes the reader yearn for a house in the country with a pantry full of staples. . . .

A team of six American security operators fought to repel the attackers and protect the Americans stationed there. Those men went beyond the call of duty, performing extraordinary acts of courage and heroism, to avert tragedy on a much larger scale.

That is billions more than the natural resources of our planet can sustain without big changes in how we use and manage them. So what happens when vast population growth endangers the world’s food supplies? Or our water? Our energy needs, climate, or environment? Or the planet’s biodiversity? What happens if some or all of these become critical at once? Just what is our future? In Tipping Point for Planet Earth, world-renowned scientists Anthony Barnosky and Elizabeth Hadly explain the growing threats to humanity as the planet edges toward resource wars for remaining space, food, oil, and water. And as they show, these wars are not the nightmares of a dystopian future, but are already happening today. Finally, they ask: at what point will inaction lead to the break-up of the intricate workings of the global society? The planet is in danger now, but the solutions, as Barnosky and Hadly show, are still available. We still have the chance to avoid the tipping point and to make the future better.

Byatt summons up a whole era, revealing that beneath its golden surface lay tensions that would explode into war, revolution and unbelievable change — for the generation that came of age before 1914 and, most of all, for their children. The novel centres around Olive Wellwood, a fairy tale writer, and her circle, which includes the brilliant, erratic craftsman Benedict Fludd and his apprentice Phillip Warren, a runaway from the poverty of the Potteries; Prosper Cain, the soldier who directs what will become the Victoria and Albert Museum; Olive’s brother-in-law Basil Wellwood, an officer of the Bank of England; and many others from every layer of society. A.S. Byatt traces their lives in intimate detail and moves between generations, following the children who must choose whether to follow the roles expected of them or stand up to their parents’ “porcelain socialism.” Olive’s daughter Dorothy wishes to become a doctor, while her other daughter, Hedda, wants to fight for votes for women. Her son Tom, sent to an upper-class school, wants nothing more than to spend time in the woods, tracking birds and foxes. Her nephew Charles becomes embroiled with German-influenced revolutionaries. Their portraits connect the political issues at the heart of nascent feminism and socialism with grave personal dilemmas, interlacing until The Children’s Book becomes a perfect depiction of an entire world. Olive is a fairy tale writer in the era of Peter Pan and Kenneth Grahame’s The Wind In the Willows, not long after Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland. At a time when children in England suffered deprivation by the millions, the concept of childhood was being refined and elaborated in ways that still influence us today. For each of her children, Olive writes a special, private book, bound in a different colour and placed on a shelf; when these same children are ferried off into the unremitting destruction of the Great War, the reader is left to wonder who the real children in this novel are. The Children’s Book is an astonishing novel. It is an historical feat that brings to life an era that helped shape our own as well as a gripping, personal novel about parents and children, life’s most painful struggles and its richest pleasures. No other writer could have imagined it or created it.', 'industryIdentifiers': [{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9780307373830'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '0307373835'}], 'readingModes': {'text': True, 'image': False}, 'pageCount': 626, 'printType': 'BOOK', 'categories': ['Fiction'], 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'allowAnonLogging': True, 'contentVersion': '0.5.3.0.preview.2', 'panelizationSummary': {'containsEpubBubbles': False, 'containsImageBubbles': False}, 'imageLinks': {'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=vvGjivw-rHgC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=vvGjivw-rHgC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}, 'language': 'en', 'previewLink': 'http://books.google.com/books?id=vvGjivw-rHgC&printsec=frontcover&dq=The+Children&hl=&as_pt=BOOKS&cd=1&source=gbs_api', 'infoLink': 'http://books.google.com/books?id=vvGjivw-rHgC&dq=The+Children&hl=&as_pt=BOOKS&source=gbs_api', 'canonicalVolumeLink': 'https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Children_s_Book.html?hl=&id=vvGjivw-rHgC'}\n",

She also falls for dangerous men and finds herself drawn into the highest levels of the cocaine trade. After two failed marriages and a harrowing escape from the drug life, she settles down to a quiet existence in Florida with her children--until her second husband tries to cut short his prison term by giving her name over to members of a new task force being formed by the DEA.

Whenever Norman gets the spotlight, the novel feels like a lost Bloch work.” —Publishers Weekly The original Psycho novel by Robert Bloch was published in 1959 and became an instant hit, leading to the smash movie only a year later, which brought Norman Bates's terrifying story into the public consciousness, where it still remains (proven by the success of the tv series, Bates Motel). It took Bloch 23 years to write another Psycho novel, revealing that Norman had been in a mental institution the entire time. In that sequel, Norman quickly escapes the sanitarium and goes on a killing spree in Hollywood. But what happened in that asylum during those two decades? Until now, no one has known. It's 1960. Norman Bates is in the State Hospital for the Criminally Insane and it's up to Dr. Felix Reed to bring him out of his catatonic state. But Norman and Dr. Reed have obstacles in twisted fellow patients and staff members who think of the institution as a prison rather than a place of healing. And the greatest obstacle is the building itself, once a private sanitarium, rumored to be haunted. A wild card appears in the persona of Robert Newman, Norman's twin brother, taken away at birth after the attending doctor pronounced him brain damaged. As Robert and Norman grow to know each other, Norman senses a darkness in Robert, even deeper than that which has lurked in Norman himself. Soon, murders begin to occur and a shocking chain of events plunge us even deeper into the deranged madness inside the walls of Psycho: Sanitarium.\", 'industryIdentifiers': [{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9781466866775'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '1466866772'}], 'readingModes': {'text': True, 'image': False}, 'pageCount': 320, 'printType': 'BOOK', 'categories': ['Fiction'], 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'allowAnonLogging': True, 'contentVersion': '1.2.2.0.preview.2', 'panelizationSummary': {'containsEpubBubbles': False, 'containsImageBubbles': False}, 'imageLinks': {'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=q6BVCgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=q6BVCgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}, 'language': 'en', 'previewLink': 'http://books.google.com/books?id=q6BVCgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Psycho:+Sanitarium+(Psycho+%231.5)&hl=&as_pt=BOOKS&cd=1&source=gbs_api', 'infoLink': 'https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=q6BVCgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api', 'canonicalVolumeLink': 'https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=q6BVCgAAQBAJ'}\n",

He loved her in spite of her cruelty. He's distraught and doesn't understand why his blended family is falling apart. After a year, the police still have no answers: Ivy could have jumped, could have been pushed, or it could have been an accident. With too many suspects and not enough evidence, the investigation has grown cold. Tommy thinks that if someone can figure out what happened to his step-sister, everything will go back to normal, so he writes to investigative reporter Maxine Revere. This isn’t the type of case Max normally takes on, but the heartbreak and simple honesty in Tommy's letter pulls her in. She travels to Corte Madera, California, with her assistant David Kane and is at first pleased that the police are cooperative. But the more Max learns about Tommy and his dysfunctional family, the more she thinks she’s taken on an impossible task: this may be the one case she can’t solve. If Ivy was murdered, it was exceptionally well-planned and that kind of killer could be hiding in plain sight ... planning the next act of violence. Max believes the truth is always better than lies, that the truth is the only thing that matters to gain justice for victims and their families.

A hysterical, ridiculous book about crippling depression and anxiety? That sounds like a terrible idea. But terrible ideas are what Jenny does best. As Jenny says: \"Some people might think that being \\'furiously happy\\' is just an excuse to be stupid and irresponsible and invite a herd of kangaroos over to your house without telling your husband first because you suspect he would say no since he\\'s never particularly liked kangaroos. And that would be ridiculous because no one would invite a herd of kangaroos into their house. Two is the limit. I speak from personal experience. My husband says that none is the new limit. I say he should have been clearer about that before I rented all those kangaroos. \"Most of my favorite people are dangerously fucked-up but you\\'d never guess because we\\'ve learned to bare it so honestly that it becomes the new normal.

It\\'s the difference between \"taking a shower\" and \"teaching your monkey butler how to shampoo your hair.\" It\\'s the difference between being \"sane\" and being \"furiously happy.\" Lawson is beloved around the world for her inimitable humor and honesty, and in Furiously Happy, she is at her snort-inducing funniest.

The rich are getting richer by rigging the system in their favor, leaving the rest of us to struggle just to keep our heads above water. To save the American Dream, we’re told that we need to fight inequality through tax hikes, wealth redistribution schemes, and a far higher minimum wage. But what if that narrative is wrong? What if the real threat to the American Dream isn’t rising income inequality—but an all-out war on success? In Equal is Unfair, a timely and thought-provoking work, Don Watkins and Yaron Brook reveal that almost everything we’ve been taught about inequality is wrong. You’ll discover: • why successful CEOs make so much money—and deserve to • how the minimum wage hurts the very people it claims to help • why middle-class stagnation is a myth • how the little-known history of Sweden reveals the dangers of forced equality • the disturbing philosophy behind Obama’s economic agenda. The critics of inequality are right about one thing: the American Dream is under attack. But instead of fighting to make America a place where anyone can achieve success, they are fighting to tear down those who already have. The real key to making America a freer, fairer, more prosperous nation is to protect and celebrate the pursuit of success—not pull down the high fliers in the name of equality.', 'industryIdentifiers': [{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9781250084453'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '1250084458'}], 'readingModes': {'text': True, 'image': False}, 'pageCount': 271, 'printType': 'BOOK', 'categories': ['Business & Economics'], 'averageRating': 3, 'ratingsCount': 2, 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'allowAnonLogging': True, 'contentVersion': '1.3.4.0.preview.2', 'panelizationSummary': {'containsEpubBubbles': False, 'containsImageBubbles': False}, 'imageLinks': {'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=TtmLCgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=TtmLCgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}, 'language': 'en', 'previewLink': 'http://books.google.com/books?id=TtmLCgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Equal+Is+Unfair:+America%27s+Misguided+Fight+Against+Income+Inequality&hl=&as_pt=BOOKS&cd=1&source=gbs_api', 'infoLink': 'https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=TtmLCgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api', 'canonicalVolumeLink': 'https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=TtmLCgAAQBAJ'}\n",

Now with an excerpt of Michelle\\'s new book, I\\'ll See You in Paris! Bienvenue à Paris! When April Vogt\\'s boss tells her about an apartment in the ninth arrondissement that has been discovered after being shuttered for the past seventy years, the Sotheby\\'s continental furniture specialist does not hear the words \"dust\" or \"rats\" or \"decrepit.\" She hears Paris. She hears escape. Once in France, April quickly learns the apartment is not merely some rich hoarder\\'s repository. Beneath the cobwebs and stale perfumed air is a goldmine, and not because of the actual gold (or painted ostrich eggs or mounted rhinoceros horns or bronze bathtub). First, there\\'s a portrait by one of the masters of the Belle Epoque, Giovanni Boldini. And then there are letters and journals written by the very woman in the painting, Marthe de Florian. These documents reveal that she was more than a renowned courtesan with enviable decolletage. Suddenly April\\'s quest is no longer about the bureaux plats and Louis-style armchairs that will fetch millions at auction. It\\'s about discovering the story behind this charismatic woman. It\\'s about discovering two women, actually. With the help of a salty (and annoyingly sexy) Parisian solicitor and the courtesan\\'s private diaries, April tries to uncover the many secrets buried in the apartment. As she digs into Marthe\\'s life, April can\\'t help but take a deeper look into her own. Having left behind in the States a cheating husband, a family crisis about to erupt, and a career she\\'s been using as the crutch to simply get by, she feels compelled to sort out her own life too. When the things she left bubbling back home begin to boil over, and Parisian delicacies beyond flaky pâtisseries tempt her better judgment, April knows that both she and Marthe deserve happy finales. Whether accompanied by croissants or champagne, this delectable debut novel depicts the Paris of the Belle Epoque and the present day with vibrant and stunning allure. Based on historical events, Michelle Gable\\'s A Paris Apartment will entertain and inspire, as readers embrace the struggles and successes of two very unforgettable women.', 'industryIdentifiers': [{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9781466849624'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '1466849622'}], 'readingModes': {'text': True, 'image': False}, 'pageCount': 384, 'printType': 'BOOK', 'categories': ['Fiction'], 'maturityRating': 'MATURE', 'allowAnonLogging': True, 'contentVersion': '3.9.8.0.preview.2', 'panelizationSummary': {'containsEpubBubbles': False, 'containsImageBubbles': False}, 'imageLinks': {'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Bc5nAgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Bc5nAgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}, 'language': 'en', 'previewLink': 'http://books.google.com/books?id=Bc5nAgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=A+Paris+Apartment&hl=&as_pt=BOOKS&cd=1&source=gbs_api', 'infoLink': 'https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Bc5nAgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api', 'canonicalVolumeLink': 'https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Bc5nAgAAQBAJ'}\n",

That willingness to speak her mind, stand her ground, and rattle the occasional cage has enabled this tough-talking girl from Brooklyn to forge an enduring and successful career in Hollywood. But being a troublemaker has come at a cost. That was never more evident than in 2013, when Remini loudly and publicly broke with the Church of Scientology. Now, in this frank, funny, poignant memoir, the former King of Queens star opens up about that experience for the first time, revealing the in-depth details of her painful split with the church and its controversial practices. Indoctrinated into the church as a child while living with her mother and sister in New York, Remini eventually moved to Los Angeles, where her dreams of becoming an actress and advancing Scientology’s causes grew increasingly intertwined. As an adult, she found the success she’d worked so hard for, and with it a prominent place in the hierarchy of celebrity Scientologists alongside people such as Tom Cruise, Scientology’s most high-profile adherent. Remini spent time directly with Cruise and was included among the guests at his 2006 wedding to Katie Holmes. But when she began to raise questions about some of the church’s actions, she found herself a target. In the end, she was declared by the church to be a threat to their organization and therefore a “Suppressive Person,” and as a result, all of her fellow parishioners—including members of her own family—were told to disconnect from her. Forever. Bold, brash, and bravely confessional, Troublemaker chronicles Leah Remini’s remarkable journey toward emotional and spiritual freedom, both for herself and for her family. This is a memoir designed to reveal the hard-won truths of a life lived honestly—from an author unafraid of the consequences. Praise for Troublemaker “An aggressively honest memoir . . . Troublemaker is the most raw and revealing Scientology memoir to date.”—Entertainment Weekly “Leah’s story is a juicy, inside-Hollywood read, but it’s more than that.

We are in the midst of a sleep deprivation crisis, with profound consequences to our health, our job performance, our relationships and our happiness. What we need is nothing short of a sleep revolution: only by renewing our relationship with sleep can we take back control of our lives. In The Sleep Revolution, Arianna explores all the latest science on what exactly is going on while we sleep and dream. She takes on the sleeping pill industry, and all the ways our addiction to technology disrupts our sleep. She also offers a range of recommendations and tips from leading scientists on how we can get better and more restorative sleep, and harness its incredible power. The result is a sweeping, scientifically rigorous, and deeply personal exploration of sleep from all angles, from the history of sleep, to the role of dreams in our lives, to the consequences of sleep deprivation, and the new golden age of sleep science that reveals the vital role sleep plays in our every waking moment and every aspect of our health--from weight gain, diabetes, and heart disease to cancer and Alzheimer’s. In today's fast-paced, always-connected, perpetually-harried and sleep-deprived world, our need for a good night’s sleep is more important--and elusive--than ever.

As a political powerhouse in late 14th century Europe, a time of war, social unrest and one of the worst natural disasters of all time--the plague, she worked for peace between Christians while campaigning for a holy crusade against Muslims. She was illiterate but grew into a great writer by dictating to assistants. She was frail and punished herself mercilessly, often starving herself, while offering moral guidance and inspiration to kings, queens and popes. It's easy to see why feminists through the years have sought to claim the patronage of St. Catherine. From her refusal to marry to her assertion that her physical appearance was of no importance, the famous Saint is ripe for modern interpretation.

Through prose that shifts fluidly between dreams and reality, past and present, we travel to Frida Kahlo’s Casa Azul in Mexico; to the fertile moon terrain of Iceland; to a ramshackle seaside bungalow in New York’s Far Rockaway that Smith acquires just before Hurricane Sandy hits; to the West 4th Street subway station, filled with the sounds of the Velvet Underground after the death of Lou Reed; and to the graves of Genet, Plath, Rimbaud, and Mishima. Woven throughout are reflections on the writer’s craft and on artistic creation. Here, too, are singular memories of Smith’s life in Michigan and the irremediable loss of her husband, Fred Sonic Smith. Braiding despair with hope and consolation, illustrated with her signature Polaroids, M Train is a meditation on travel, detective shows, literature, and coffee.

Inspired by the life of a real World War II heroine, this remarkable debut novel reveals the power of unsung women to change history in their quest for love, freedom, and second chances. “Extremely moving and memorable . . . This impressive debut should appeal strongly to historical fiction readers and to book clubs that adored Kristin Hannah’s The Nightingale and Anthony Doerr’s All the Light We Cannot See.”—Library Journal (starred review) New York socialite Caroline Ferriday has her hands full with her post at the French consulate and a new love on the horizon. But Caroline’s world is forever changed when Hitler’s army invades Poland in September 1939—and then sets its sights on France. An ocean away from Caroline, Kasia Kuzmerick, a Polish teenager, senses her carefree youth disappearing as she is drawn deeper into her role as courier for the underground resistance movement. In a tense atmosphere of watchful eyes and suspecting neighbors, one false move can have dire consequences. For the ambitious young German doctor, Herta Oberheuser, an ad for a government medical position seems her ticket out of a desolate life. Once hired, though, she finds herself trapped in a male-dominated realm of Nazi secrets and power. The lives of these three women are set on a collision course when the unthinkable happens and Kasia is sent to Ravensbrück, the notorious Nazi concentration camp for women. Their stories cross continents—from New York to Paris, Germany, and Poland—as Caroline and Kasia strive to bring justice to those whom history has forgotten.

Anxiety. Chronic Pain. Phobias. Obsessive thoughts. The evidence is compelling: the roots of these difficulties may not reside in our immediate life experience or in chemical imbalances in our brains—but in the lives of our parents, grandparents, and even great-grandparents. The latest scientific research, now making headlines, supports what many have long intuited—that traumatic experience can be passed down through generations. It Didn’t Start with You builds on the work of leading experts in post-traumatic stress, including Mount Sinai School of Medicine neuroscientist Rachel Yehuda and psychiatrist Bessel van der Kolk, author of The Body Keeps the Score. Even if the person who suffered the original trauma has died, or the story has been forgotten or silenced, memory and feelings can live on. These emotional legacies are often hidden, encoded in everything from gene expression to everyday language, and they play a far greater role in our emotional and physical health than has ever before been understood. As a pioneer in the field of inherited family trauma, Mark Wolynn has worked with individuals and groups on a therapeutic level for over twenty years. It Didn’t Start with You offers a pragmatic and prescriptive guide to his method, the Core Language Approach. Diagnostic self-inventories provide a way to uncover the fears and anxieties conveyed through everyday words, behaviors, and physical symptoms. Techniques for developing a genogram or extended family tree create a map of experiences going back through the generations. And visualization, active imagination, and direct dialogue create pathways to reconnection, integration, and reclaiming life and health.

Rather than the more familiar metaphor of prostitution, Nichols used adultery to define loveless marriages as a betrayal of the self, a consequence far more serious than the violation of a legal contract. Nichols was not alone. In Unfaithful, Carol Faulkner places this view of adultery at the center of nineteenth-century efforts to redefine marriage as a voluntary relationship in which love alone determined fidelity. After the Revolution, Americans understood adultery as a sin against God and a crime against the people. A betrayal of marriage vows, adultery was a cause for divorce in most states as well as a basis for civil suits. Faulkner depicts an array of nineteenth-century social reformers who challenged the restrictive legal institution of marriage, redefining adultery as a matter of individual choice and love. She traces the beginning of this redefinition of adultery to the evangelical ferment of the 1830s and 1840s, when perfectionists like John Humphrey Noyes, founder of the Oneida Community, concluded that marriage obstructed the individual's relationship to God. In the 1840s and 1850s, spiritualist, feminist, and free love critics of marriage fueled a growing debate over adultery and marriage by emphasizing true love and consent. After the Civil War, activists turned the act of adultery into a form of civil disobedience, culminating in Victoria Woodhull's publicly charging the Reverend Henry Ward Beecher with marital infidelity. Unfaithful explores how nineteenth-century reformers mobilized both the metaphor and the act of adultery to redefine marriage between 1830 and 1880 and the ways in which their criticisms of the legal institution contributed to a larger transformation of marital and gender relations that continues to this day.\", 'industryIdentifiers': [{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9780812296792'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '0812296796'}], 'readingModes': {'text': True, 'image': True}, 'pageCount': 224, 'printType': 'BOOK', 'categories': ['History'], 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'allowAnonLogging': False, 'contentVersion': '0.2.1.0.preview.3', 'panelizationSummary': {'containsEpubBubbles': False, 'containsImageBubbles': False}, 'imageLinks': {'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=IYC-DwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=IYC-DwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}, 'language': 'en', 'previewLink': 'http://books.google.com/books?id=IYC-DwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Adultery&hl=&as_pt=BOOKS&cd=1&source=gbs_api', 'infoLink': 'https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=IYC-DwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api', 'canonicalVolumeLink': 'https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=IYC-DwAAQBAJ'}\n",

J. Charles. Among his eccentric though strictly principled group of friends, Lord Richard Vane is the confidant on whom everyone depends for advice, moral rectitude, and discreet assistance. Yet when Richard has a problem, he turns to his valet, a fixer of unparalleled genius—and the object of Richard’s deepest desires. If there is one rule a gentleman must follow, it is never to dally with servants. But when David is close enough to touch, the rules of class collide with the basest sort of animal instinct: overpowering lust. For David Cyprian, burglary and blackmail are as much in a day’s work as bootblacking—anything for the man he’s devoted to. But the one thing he wants for himself is the one thing Richard refuses to give: his heart. With the tension between them growing to be unbearable, David’s seemingly incorruptible master has left him no choice. Putting his finely honed skills of seduction and manipulation to good use, he will convince Richard to forget all about his well-meaning objections and give in to sweet, sinful temptation.

Finally, Harris stumbled upon an effective way to rein in that voice, something he always assumed to be either impossible or useless: meditation, a tool that research suggests can do everything from lower your blood pressure to essentially rewire your brain. 10% Happier takes readers on a ride from the outer reaches of neuroscience to the inner sanctum of network news to the bizarre fringes of America’s spiritual scene, and leaves them with a takeaway that could actually change their lives.', 'industryIdentifiers': [{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9780062265449'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '006226544X'}], 'readingModes': {'text': True, 'image': False}, 'pageCount': 299, 'printType': 'BOOK', 'categories': ['Self-Help'], 'averageRating': 4, 'ratingsCount': 4, 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'allowAnonLogging': True, 'contentVersion': '1.15.14.0.preview.2', 'panelizationSummary': {'containsEpubBubbles': False, 'containsImageBubbles': False}, 'imageLinks': {'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ycEKAgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ycEKAgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}, 'language': 'en', 'previewLink': 'http://books.google.com/books?id=ycEKAgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=10%25+Happier:+How+I+Tamed+the+Voice+in+My+Head,+Reduced+Stress+Without+Losing+My+Edge,+and+Found+Self-Help+That+Actually+Works&hl=&as_pt=BOOKS&cd=1&source=gbs_api', 'infoLink': 'http://books.google.com/books?id=ycEKAgAAQBAJ&dq=10%25+Happier:+How+I+Tamed+the+Voice+in+My+Head,+Reduced+Stress+Without+Losing+My+Edge,+and+Found+Self-Help+That+Actually+Works&hl=&as_pt=BOOKS&source=gbs_api', 'canonicalVolumeLink': 'https://books.google.com/books/about/10_Happier.html?hl=&id=ycEKAgAAQBAJ'}\n",

Since her mother discourages these beliefs, Ella keeps her cemetery visits secret. But she may not be the only one with secrets. Ella’s mother might be lying about how Dad died sixteen years ago. Newfound evidence points to his death in a psychiatric hospital, not as a result of a tragic car accident as her mother always claimed. After a lifetime of just the two of them, Mom suddenly feels like a stranger. When a handprint much like the one Ella left on her father’s tombstone mysteriously appears on the bathroom mirror, at first she wonders if Dad is warning her of danger as he did once before. If it’s not a warning, could her new too-good-to-be-true boyfriend be responsible for the strange occurrences? Or maybe it’s the grieving building superintendent whose dead daughter strongly resembles Ella? As the unexplained events become more frequent and more sinister, Ella becomes terrified about who—or what—might harm her. Soon the evidence points to someone else entirely: Ella herself. What if, like her father, she’s suffering from a breakdown? In this second novel from award-winning author Yvonne Ventresca, Ella desperately needs to find answers, no matter how disturbing the truth might be.

In Zero to One, legendary entrepreneur and investor Peter Thiel shows how we can find singular ways to create those new things. Thiel begins with the contrarian premise that we live in an age of technological stagnation, even if we’re too distracted by shiny mobile devices to notice. Information technology has improved rapidly, but there is no reason why progress should be limited to computers or Silicon Valley. Progress can be achieved in any industry or area of business. It comes from the most important skill that every leader must master: learning to think for yourself. Doing what someone else already knows how to do takes the world from 1 to n, adding more of something familiar. But when you do something new, you go from 0 to 1. The next Bill Gates will not build an operating system. The next Larry Page or Sergey Brin won’t make a search engine. Tomorrow’s champions will not win by competing ruthlessly in today’s marketplace. They will escape competition altogether, because their businesses will be unique.

In “How to Look Spectacular: A Starlet’s Confessions,” Kaling gives her tongue-in-cheek secrets for surefire on-camera beauty, (“Your natural hair color may be appropriate for your skin tone, but this isn’t the land of appropriate–this is Hollywood, baby. Out here, a dark-skinned woman’s traditional hair color is honey blonde.”) “Player” tells the story of Kaling being seduced and dumped by a female friend in L.A. (“I had been replaced by a younger model. And now they had matching bangs.”) In “Unlikely Leading Lady,” she muses on America’s fixation with the weight of actresses, (“Most women we see onscreen are either so thin that they’re walking clavicles or so huge that their only scenes involve them breaking furniture.”) And in “Soup Snakes,” Kaling spills some secrets on her relationship with her ex-boyfriend and close friend, B.J.

One day he was a doctor treating the dying, and the next he was a patient struggling to live. And just like that, the future he and his wife had imagined evaporated. When Breath Becomes Air chronicles Kalanithi’s transformation from a naïve medical student “possessed,” as he wrote, “by the question of what, given that all organisms die, makes a virtuous and meaningful life” into a neurosurgeon at Stanford working in the brain, the most critical place for human identity, and finally into a patient and new father confronting his own mortality. What makes life worth living in the face of death? What do you do when the future, no longer a ladder toward your goals in life, flattens out into a perpetual present? What does it mean to have a child, to nurture a new life as another fades away? These are some of the questions Kalanithi wrestles with in this profoundly moving, exquisitely observed memoir. Paul Kalanithi died in March 2015, while working on this book, yet his words live on as a guide and a gift to us all. “I began to realize that coming face to face with my own mortality, in a sense, had changed nothing and everything,” he wrote. “Seven words from Samuel Beckett began to repeat in my head: ‘I can’t go on.

Byron Hemmings wakes to a morning that looks like any other: his school uniform draped over his wooden desk chair, his sister arguing over the breakfast cereal, the click of his mother’s heels as she crosses the kitchen. But when the three of them leave home, driving into a dense summer fog, the morning takes an unmistakable turn. In one terrible moment, something happens, something completely unexpected and at odds with life as Byron understands it. While his mother seems not to have noticed, eleven-year-old Byron understands that from now on nothing can be the same. What happened and who is to blame? Over the days and weeks that follow, Byron’s perfect world is shattered. Unable to trust his parents, he confides in his best friend, James, and together they concoct a plan. . . . As she did in her debut, The Unlikely Pilgrimage of Harold Fry, Rachel Joyce has imagined bewitching characters who find their ordinary lives unexpectedly thrown into chaos, who learn that there are times when children must become parents to their parents, and who discover that in confronting the hard truths about their pasts, they will forge unexpected relationships that have profound and surprising impacts. Brimming with love, forgiveness, and redemption, Perfect will cement Rachel Joyce’s reputation as one of fiction’s brightest talents. Praise for Perfect “Touching, eccentric . . . Joyce does an inviting job of setting up these mysterious circumstances, and of drawing Byron’s magical closeness with Diana.”—Janet Maslin, The New York Times “Haunting . . . compelling.”—Minneapolis Star Tribune “[Joyce] triumphantly returns with Perfect. . . . As Joyce probes the souls of Diana, Byron and Jim, she reveals—slowly and deliberately, as if peeling back a delicate onion skin—the connection between the two stories, creating a poignant, searching tale.”—O: The Oprah Magazine “Perfect touches on class, mental illness, and the ways a psyche is formed or broken. It has the tenor of a horror film, and yet at the end, in some kind of contortionist trick, the narrative unfolds into an unexpected burst of redemption. [Verdict:] Buy It.”—New York “Joyce’s dark, quiet follow-up to her successful debut, The Unlikely Pilgrimage of Harold Fry, could easily become a book club favorite. . . . Perfect is the kind of book that blossoms under thoughtful examination, its slow tendencies redeemed by moments of loveliness and insight. However sad, Joyce’s messages—about the limitations of time and control, the failures of adults and the fears of children, and our responsibility for our own imprisonment and freedom—have a gentle ring of truth to them.”—The Washington Post “There is a poignancy to Joyce’s narrative that makes for her most memorable writing.”—NPR’s All Things Considered', 'industryIdentifiers': [{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9780679645122'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '0679645128'}], 'readingModes': {'text': True, 'image': False}, 'pageCount': 351, 'printType': 'BOOK', 'categories': ['Fiction'], 'averageRating': 5, 'ratingsCount': 1, 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'allowAnonLogging': True, 'contentVersion': '1.10.9.0.preview.2', 'panelizationSummary': {'containsEpubBubbles': False, 'containsImageBubbles': False}, 'imageLinks': {'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=jSgUAAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=jSgUAAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}, 'language': 'en', 'previewLink': 'http://books.google.com/books?id=jSgUAAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=The+Unlikely+Pilgrimage+of+Harold+Fry+(Harold+Fry+%231)&hl=&as_pt=BOOKS&cd=1&source=gbs_api', 'infoLink': 'https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=jSgUAAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api', 'canonicalVolumeLink': 'https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=jSgUAAAAQBAJ'}\n",

Traveling in one of Europe’s earliest automobiles, he sets out in search of this strange treasure. Thirty-five years later, a Portuguese pathologist devoted to the murder mysteries of Agatha Christie finds himself at the center of a mystery of his own and drawn into the consequences of Tomás’s quest. Fifty years on, a Canadian senator takes refuge in his ancestral village in northern Portugal, grieving the loss of his beloved wife. But he arrives with an unusual companion: a chimpanzee. And there the century-old quest will come to an unexpected conclusion. The High Mountains of Portugal—part quest, part ghost story, part contemporary fable—offers a haunting exploration of great love and great loss. Filled with tenderness, humor, and endless surprise, it takes the reader on a road trip through Portugal in the last century—and through the human soul. Praise for The High Mountains of Portugal “Just as ambitious, just as clever, just as existential and spiritual [as Life of Pi] . . . a book that rewards your attention . . . an excellent book club choice.”—San Francisco Chronicle “There’s no denying the simple pleasures to be had in The High Mountains of Portugal.”—Chicago Tribune “Charming . . . Most Martellian is the boundless capacity for parable. . . . Martel knows his strengths: passages about the chimpanzee and his owner brim irresistibly with affection and attentiveness.”—The New Yorker “A rich and rewarding experience . . . [Martel] spins his magic thread of hope and despair, comedy and pathos.”—USA Today “I took away indelible images from High Mountains, enchanting and disturbing at the same time. . . . As whimsical as Martel’s magic realism can be, grief informs every step of the book’s three journeys. In the course of the novel we burrow ever further into the heart of an ape, pure and threatening at once, our precursor, ourselves.”—NPR “Refreshing, surprising and filled with sparkling moments of humor and insight.”—The Dallas Morning News “We’re fortunate to have brilliant writers using their fiction to meditate on a paradox we need urgently to consider—the unbridgeable gap and the unbreakable bond between human and animal, our impossible self-alienation from our world.”—Ursula K. Le Guin, The Guardian “[Martel packs] his inventive novel with beguiling ideas.

In Smarter Faster Better, he applies the same relentless curiosity and rich storytelling to how we can improve at the things we do.

Drawing on the latest findings in neuroscience, psychology, and behavioral economics—as well as the experiences of CEOs, educational reformers, four-star generals, FBI agents, airplane pilots, and Broadway songwriters—this book reveals that the most productive people, companies, and organizations don’t merely act differently.

When we own our stories, we get to write the ending. Don’t miss the five-part HBO Max docuseries Brené Brown: Atlas of the Heart! Social scientist Brené Brown has ignited a global conversation on courage, vulnerability, shame, and worthiness. Her pioneering work uncovered a profound truth: Vulnerability—the willingness to show up and be seen with no guarantee of outcome—is the only path to more love, belonging, creativity, and joy. But living a brave life is not always easy: We are, inevitably, going to stumble and fall. It is the rise from falling that Brown takes as her subject in Rising Strong. As a grounded theory researcher, Brown has listened as a range of people—from leaders in Fortune 500 companies and the military to artists, couples in long-term relationships, teachers, and parents—shared their stories of being brave, falling, and getting back up. She asked herself, What do these people with strong and loving relationships, leaders nurturing creativity, artists pushing innovation, and clergy walking with people through faith and mystery have in common? The answer was clear: They recognize the power of emotion and they’re not afraid to lean in to discomfort. Walking into our stories of hurt can feel dangerous. But the process of regaining our footing in the midst of struggle is where our courage is tested and our values are forged. Our stories of struggle can be big ones, like the loss of a job or the end of a relationship, or smaller ones, like a conflict with a friend or colleague. Regardless of magnitude or circumstance, the rising strong process is the same: We reckon with our emotions and get curious about what we’re feeling; we rumble with our stories until we get to a place of truth; and we live this process, every day, until it becomes a practice and creates nothing short of a revolution in our lives. Rising strong after a fall is how we cultivate wholeheartedness. It’s the process, Brown writes, that teaches us the most about who we are.

In this novel, where so much is about what vanishes, there is also a deep beating heart, of what also stays.”—The New York Times Book Review For generations the Millers have lived in Miller’s Valley. Mimi Miller tells about her life with intimacy and honesty. As Mimi eavesdrops on her parents and quietly observes the people around her, she discovers more and more about the toxicity of family secrets, the dangers of gossip, the flaws of marriage, the inequalities of friendship and the risks of passion, loyalty, and love. Home, as Mimi begins to realize, can be “a place where it’s just as easy to feel lost as it is to feel content.” Miller’s Valley is a masterly study of family, memory, loss, and, ultimately, discovery, of finding true identity and a new vision of home. As Mimi says, “No one ever leaves the town where they grew up, even if they go.” Miller’s Valley reminds us that the place where you grew up can disappear, and the people in it too, but all will live on in your heart forever.', 'industryIdentifiers': [{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9780812985900'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '0812985907'}], 'readingModes': {'text': False, 'image': False}, 'pageCount': 289, 'printType': 'BOOK', 'categories': ['Fiction'], 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'allowAnonLogging': False, 'contentVersion': '0.5.1.0.preview.0', 'panelizationSummary': {'containsEpubBubbles': False, 'containsImageBubbles': False}, 'imageLinks': {'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=rB_ODgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=rB_ODgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}, 'language': 'en', 'previewLink': 'http://books.google.com/books?id=rB_ODgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Miller%27s+Valley&hl=&as_pt=BOOKS&cd=1&source=gbs_api', 'infoLink': 'http://books.google.com/books?id=rB_ODgAAQBAJ&dq=Miller%27s+Valley&hl=&as_pt=BOOKS&source=gbs_api', 'canonicalVolumeLink': 'https://books.google.com/books/about/Miller_s_Valley.html?hl=&id=rB_ODgAAQBAJ'}\n",

How should a dial on a radio feel to the touch? These were questions John Vassos asked when the Radio Corporation of America (RCA) asked him to design the first mass-produced television receiver, the TRK-12, which had its spectacular premier at the 1939 New York World’s Fair. Vassos emigrated from Greece and arrived in the United States in 1918. His career spans the evolution of central forms of mass media in the twentieth century and offers a template for understanding their success. This is Vassos’s legacy—shaping the way we interact with our media technologies. Other industrial designers may be more celebrated, but none were more focused on making radio and television attractive and accessible to millions of Americans. In John Vassos: Industrial Design for Modern Life, Danielle Shapiro is the first to examine the life and work of RCA’s key consultant designer through the rise of radio and television and into the computer era. Vassos conceived a vision for the look of new technologies still with us today. A founder of the Industrial Designers Society of America, he was instrumental in the development of a self-conscious industrial design profession during the late 1920s and 1930s and into the postwar period. Drawing on unpublished records and correspondence, Shapiro creates a portrait of a designer whose early artistic work in books like Phobia and Contempo critiqued the commercialization of modern life but whose later design work sought to accommodate it.

Award-winning nature writer Sharman Apt Russell felt pressed by the current environmental crisis to pick up her pen yet again. Encouraged by the phenomenon of citizen science, she decided to turn her attention to the Western red-bellied tiger beetle, an insect found widely around the world and near her home in the Gila River Valley of New Mexico. In a lyrical, often humorous voice, Russell shares her journey across a wild, rural landscape tracking this little-known species, an insect she calls “charismatic,” “elegant,” and “fierce.” What she finds is renewed optimism in mysteries still left to be explored, that despite the challenges of climate change, there is a growing diversity of ways ordinary people can contribute to the research needs of scientists today in the name of environmental activism. Offering readers a glimpse into the pioneering field of citizen science, Diary of a Citizen Scientist documents one woman’s transformation from a feeling of powerlessness to engaged hopefulness.

Americans have built an empire on the idea of “race,” a falsehood that damages us all but falls most heavily on the bodies of black women and men—bodies exploited through slavery and segregation, and, today, threatened, locked up, and murdered out of all proportion. What is it like to inhabit a black body and find a way to live within it? And how can we all honestly reckon with this fraught history and free ourselves from its burden? Between the World and Me is Ta-Nehisi Coates’s attempt to answer these questions in a letter to his adolescent son. Coates shares with his son—and readers—the story of his awakening to the truth about his place in the world through a series of revelatory experiences, from Howard University to Civil War battlefields, from the South Side of Chicago to Paris, from his childhood home to the living rooms of mothers whose children’s lives were taken as American plunder.

But in the inevitable condition of aging and death, the goals of medicine seem too frequently to run counter to the interest of the human spirit. Nursing homes, preoccupied with safety, pin patients into railed beds and wheelchairs. Hospitals isolate the dying, checking for vital signs long after the goals of cure have become moot. Doctors, committed to extending life, continue to carry out devastating procedures that in the end extend suffering. Gawande, a practicing surgeon, addresses his profession's ultimate limitation, arguing that quality of life is the desired goal for patients and families. Gawande offers examples of freer, more socially fulfilling models for assisting the infirm and dependent elderly, and he explores the varieties of hospice care to demonstrate that a person's last weeks or months may be rich and dignified. Full of eye-opening research and riveting storytelling, Being Mortal asserts that medicine can comfort and enhance our experience even to the end, providing not only a good life but also a good end.\", 'industryIdentifiers': [{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9781627790550'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '1627790551'}], 'readingModes': {'text': True, 'image': False}, 'pageCount': 304, 'printType': 'BOOK', 'categories': ['Social Science'], 'averageRating': 4.5, 'ratingsCount': 5, 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'allowAnonLogging': True, 'contentVersion': '2.16.18.0.preview.2', 'panelizationSummary': {'containsEpubBubbles': False, 'containsImageBubbles': False}, 'imageLinks': {'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=tM1zAwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=tM1zAwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}, 'language': 'en', 'previewLink': 'http://books.google.com/books?id=tM1zAwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Being+Mortal:+Medicine+and+What+Matters+in+the+End&hl=&as_pt=BOOKS&cd=1&source=gbs_api', 'infoLink': 'https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=tM1zAwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api', 'canonicalVolumeLink': 'https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=tM1zAwAAQBAJ'}\n",

O. Green Junior High in Oxnard, CA, 14-year-old Brandon McInerney shot and killed his classmate, Larry King, who had recently begun to call himself \"Leticia\" and wear makeup and jewelry to school. Profoundly shaken by the news, and unsettled by media coverage that sidestepped the issues of gender identity and of race integral to the case, psychologist Ken Corbett traveled to LA to attend the trial. As visions of victim and perpetrator were woven and unwoven in the theater of the courtroom, a haunting picture emerged not only of the two young teenagers, but also of spectators altered by an atrocity and of a community that had unwittingly gestated a murder. Drawing on firsthand observations, extensive interviews and research, as well as on his decades of academic work on gender and sexuality, Corbett holds each murky facet of this case up to the light, exploring the fault lines of memory and the lacunae of uncertainty behind facts.

NAMED ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS OF THE YEAR BY NPR In an industry where celebrity chefs are known as much for their salty talk and quick tempers as their food, Eric Ripert stands out. The winner of four James Beard Awards, co-owner and chef of a world-renowned restaurant, and recipient of countless Michelin stars, Ripert embodies elegance and culinary perfection. But before the accolades, before he even knew how to make a proper hollandaise sauce, Eric Ripert was a lonely young boy in the south of France whose life was falling apart. Ripert’s parents divorced when he was six, separating him from the father he idolized and replacing him with a cold, bullying stepfather who insisted that Ripert be sent away to boarding school. A few years later, Ripert’s father died on a hiking trip. Through these tough times, the one thing that gave Ripert comfort was food. Told that boys had no place in the kitchen, Ripert would instead watch from the doorway as his mother rolled couscous by hand or his grandmother pressed out the buttery dough for the treat he loved above all others, tarte aux pommes. When an eccentric local chef took him under his wing, an eleven-year-old Ripert realized that food was more than just an escape: It was his calling. That passion would carry him through the drudgery of culinary school and into the high-pressure world of Paris’s most elite restaurants, where Ripert discovered that learning to cook was the easy part—surviving the line was the battle. Taking us from Eric Ripert’s childhood in the south of France and the mountains of Andorra into the demanding kitchens of such legendary Parisian chefs as Joël Robuchon and Dominique Bouchet, until, at the age of twenty-four, Ripert made his way to the United States, 32 Yolks is the tender and richly told story of how one of our greatest living chefs found himself—and his home—in the kitchen. Praise for 32 Yolks “Passionate, poetical . . . What makes 32 Yolks compelling is the honesty and laudable humility Ripert brings to the telling.”—Chicago Tribune “With a vulnerability and honesty that is breathtaking . . .

For parents of toddlers, it\\'s a \"you better laugh so you don\\'t cry\" period. Bunmi Laditan\\'s hilarious, satirical guide to toddlerhood offers parents instant (and very welcome) comic relief—along with the very good news that \"It\\'s Not Your Fault.\" Chapters cover the cost of raising a toddler, feeding your toddler, potty-training, tantrums, how to manage the holidays, and \"how not to die inside.\" Parents will see themselves in the very funny sections on taking your toddler to restaurants (\"One parent will spend their time walking your toddler around the restaurant and outside like a cocker spaniel, while the other, luckier parent will eat alone.\"), Things You Thought You\\'d Never Say That You Now Say As a Parent of a Toddler (\"I can tell you\\'re pooping because your eyes are watering.\"), and how to order pizza (\"Spend $40 on pizza delivery. Listen to your toddler cry for 30 minutes about how the pizza is all wrong. Watch your toddler take a small bite of crust. Google \\'can anger give you a heart attack?\\' Start the bedtime routine.\"). Laditan\\'s wildly funny voice has attracted hundreds of thousands of fans of Honest Toddler on social media; here she speaks parent-to-tired-parent, easing the pains and challenges of raising toddlers with a hefty dose of adult humor and wit.', 'industryIdentifiers': [{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9780761185758'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '0761185755'}], 'readingModes': {'text': True, 'image': False}, 'pageCount': 176, 'printType': 'BOOK', 'categories': ['Humor'], 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'allowAnonLogging': True, 'contentVersion': '1.6.6.0.preview.2', 'panelizationSummary': {'containsEpubBubbles': False, 'containsImageBubbles': False}, 'imageLinks': {'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=BV5aBgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=BV5aBgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}, 'language': 'en', 'previewLink': 'http://books.google.com/books?id=BV5aBgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Toddlers+Are+A**holes:+It%27s+Not+Your+Fault&hl=&as_pt=BOOKS&cd=1&source=gbs_api', 'infoLink': 'https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=BV5aBgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api', 'canonicalVolumeLink': 'https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=BV5aBgAAQBAJ'}\n",
